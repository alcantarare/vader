It is overheating my device, and it has audio issues. I was forced to use it for school. It was alright, worth about 3 stars, but now it's worth nothing. The picture quality is atrocious in low light. It also takes so much power, that my device gets really hot. There is also a glitch/bug that makes people on the other end unable to hear me. The only solution is to use my mom's headset. Overall the quality is terrible.	N	{'neg': 0.098, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': -0.3716}	-0.3716	0.098	0.811	0.092	N
This may be a popular app for many people but for me it was absolute garbage. I have literally spent hours trying to make the sound work. I have followed all the instructions. I have turn the sound on in the app and make sure that all of the settings are correct per the instructions from Zoom. Force stop the application and clear cache. Restart the device. Clean up residual garbage with the CCleaner app. No sound. This app is just garbage	N	{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': 0.7351}	0.7351	0.06	0.814	0.126	P
For the past few weeks, I am experiencing a major problem with this app. I would often get disconnected at times during a meeting, even in the presence of a strong internet connection. And it would not even reconnect by itself, and then I have to rejoin the class manually. It is a headache especially at times when the meeting has waiting room enabled, and the host has to let me in on and on again. Plz help , if anyone can fix this problem.

The video quality has become very lousy, and since the last few updates, the internet connectivity has really been very difficult lately, and people have complained that they're having problems viewing what I'm saying with my signs. Either the screen goes dark, or freezes up or I get kicked out of my church service. Could the development team do something about this please? This is getting very frustrating for my deaf friends and I. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡	N	{'neg': 0.196, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.063, 'compound': -0.8998}	-0.8998	0.196	0.741	0.063	N
Would rate 0 stars if that would have been possible. First off this app needs a very good connection to internet which creates all kinds of problems. Sometimes its not the connection fault its the apps fault like sometimes i have a good connection than also the meeting doesn't go smoothly. Try some other meeting app and avoid this.

I uninstalled this app before due to the hassles I have experienced just to connect a call. Often had to rather switch to a different platform. Now due to the unfortunate popularity of zoom, I have to make use of this again. First call didn't connect. I feel their meeting ID system is not good at all.

My family had a virtual Thanksgiving, we were relying on Zoom and such a disappointment the audio would not work. We tried everything to get it to work and wouldn't we even tried a few hours later thinking too many people were on and still one of us couldn't hear and I was the only one alone for the holiday and when we all finally were able to get on I couldn't hear anyone's conversation and broke my heart.

This app has so many problems on my phone, it overrides current calls that I'm on when I'm on a cell phone call, it continues to ring after answering on my desktop, the Bluetooth keeps connecting as of in a call over and over again after a call is received whether I answer or not, it does not always show the missed call details, it will ring randomly for a call that was hours ago.

This is the worst app ever. I am having multiple problems with this app. 1) When I am attending my class, after just attending 10 minutes of my class my battery gets really hot. 2) After 30 minutes of attending the class, my battery will be 50 percent if I had 100 percent before attending the class. ( My phone is Galaxy m01) 3) Zoom takes up a lot of data. If I have a class that lasts 30 minutes or at the most 40 minutes, a message would pop up saying your data pack is over.

I don't really recommend this app. This app has a lot of glitches which is down not let me in to meetings and more. This app is pretty bad to use, especially if you're trying to join a zoom meeting. This glitch I'm talking about is whatever I tried putting the correct passcode like 30 times it's always says that not the correct passcode. This glitch is really annoying. There are other glitches but this review be too long if I talk about them. So yeah I don't recommend	N	{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.1716}	0.1716	0.087	0.82	0.094	P
The reason I have given this app 1 star is the recent update since I have updated the app whenever I try to freeze my video this app automatically turns the camera off.

It had so many connectivity problems. It didn't even let me to connect to the meeting because of which I missed few of my classes.

Most of the time, it shows error code 5. It's really irritating. In previous versions of zoom, it doesn't shows that, but in the latest version it does. Sometimes it behaves like internet connection is poor. It doesn't loads. My internet is coming enough to load and work properly. I missed my very important meeting due to this issue.

This would have been my first meeting except for the video and audio being off I was kicked out. It only took a few minutes to figure out how to enable it but it was to late I was removed.

The baddest of all the apps. It takes so much internet that I can not tell. First I have used my mobile network but it shows connecting only. Then after I used Wi-Fi,still it is connecting. I am very disappointed with this app. The previous update was good. And after taking so much internet, when our Wi-Fi is not capable of giving more internet, again it starts connecting. I cannot attend my school and tuition classes. So I expect something more like using less internet from this app.	N	{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': -0.3356}	-0.3356	0.099	0.826	0.075	N
This is not good app. My daughter is always having problems with connection. There were couple of times when it said that the meeting(online class) had not started yet, even as we tried a lot of times to get in, when actually they were already in the middle of the class. And when my daughter is already in, it was either she is always disconnected or she can't see anything or hear her teacher. I hope that these issues will be dealt with.

Kind of a bootleg Skype in my opinion. If I only use my phone for this, I constantly have to swipe the screen for transferring between people on screen. I can only see 4 people per screen, so I'm constantly having to flip back and forth to actually look at who is speaking if the meeting has more than 4. Kinda dumb really.

When ever I am present in a meeting it kicks me off immediately and after a few seconds it will come back into the connection screen yet to no avail thinking it will not do it again but I was wrong it does it around every minute or so. Also it is a battery drainer every time I am on the app. Honestly I wouldn't recommend anyone to use this app until all of the bugs and glitches are fixed.

It is good with many features maturing with time However it does keep exiting, crashing, incompatible when using bluetooth speaker, repeated rebooting This happens to me on different smartphones and not one So the software needs to become more for a smooth or stable experience. .

We always have to write a meeting Id and password and sometimes the password does not work. And on mobile if i sign in , zoom then changes my name and I have to rename everytime. And if I am removed by the host, zoom then tells that you were removed once and you cannot join again. Even the 2 stars I gave are not worth it.

The desktop version works well but the mobile is very weird. I use it to watch classes from college and sometimes I have to watch it over the phone which is a nightmare! These are the problems I experienced: - Not allowed to use bluetooth headphones with no mics - no control over audio if the host is showing a video(which is normally very low) - The audio of the video which the host is showing gets cut if you go to the chat or if you minimize the app	N	{'neg': 0.173, 'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.015, 'compound': -0.9444}	-0.9444	0.173	0.812	0.015	N
Hi all I wanted to share my experience with zoom with you all.... It's a good app....but the only thing is that a lot of problems occur while a meeting is hosted or I host a meeting...for instance I was not able to unmute, not able to leave, Keeps on turning off my video...so on I hope that it functions properly on the future without any discrepancy....

You cant even change the stream video quality. Say if I want to conserve my internet data, I cannot change or lower the quality of video for that. The quality of video is fixed by the app itself.

Earlier it was good, but now there is problem in the app. There has been an option call over internet since the last few updates. This option is very bad.

Technically proficient video conferencing app, but poor user interface. I keep seeing people struggling with muting/unmuting.

I had a job interview and downloaded the app; the video pixelated, sound hiccupped, and the connection was awful. I apologized for my connection and asked if I could try to reset. I did so, and while that was going, I used SpeedTest to confirm my connection was humming with 108+ Mbps Up, 38+ Mpbs Down. Reconnected, same issue. I asked for one more chance to avoid a reschedule and they allowed it. I uninstalled the app and loaded through my browser: fixed. TL;DR - App is trash, use browser.

Attended a meeting last night where the host opened all participants' videos & audios for the whole duration. I could NOT see where my video & audio were & also have no option of turning them off!

The app is good but it doesn't retriev the mobile data properly .It should suck max data speed but should give a good video quality ...

Another lack of security features in the Zoom video conferencing app is that the meetings aren't encrypted end-to-end.

Not a good app. The security isn't strong at all, hence it isn't that strenuous to hack into meetings. There has been an instance of me being hacked. Once, somebody hacked into my online class and changed my name to a slur and the teachers didn't let me in afterwards due to my intolerant name.

For the price I pay, this is severely lacking. On the whiteboard, I can't copy and paste text or images. Enabling original sound is complicated. 1 GB of cloud storage is a joke. A paid account should come with 100GB minimum. I can't adjust the size of other screens on mobile. On PC, I can't adjust the size of screens at all when sharing my screen. The chat often disappears when sharing my screen (it didn't use to). On PC, I should be able to use two cameras simultaneously.

It is good at everything but I found a new update in zoom. It is if we go to participants or chat the video will be off. I hope that you will make some more changes and the video should be continuing if we go to participants and chat.

I am adding a new review to this... My sister was trying 5o organize a prayer group! But I soon learned that as a group , on my side when we prayed together it was sounding like a gargling contest! The sounds brown up , especially when she rung bells and talked at the same time! Of course she said that did not happen to her! Perhaps because she uses a lap top or computer!

Zoom is providing free meetings for online classes in this pandemic. But I do wanna suggest you a thing about developing your app. - Change the UI of the app so that it'll be liked by everyone. - Also add an option in the settings menu to autostart a scheduled zoom meeting. - Change the designing of the total app. - Also add an update of zooming others video. If you do this you can get good rating and I'm sure of it.Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€° Expecting a lot from you..	P	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.131, 'compound': 0.9127}	0.9127	0.0	0.869	0.131	P

If you are the host it is terrible.

The Experience of the app isn't as good as the desktop version. One thing which is terrible, is the lack in video setting options. If you wear black, zoom automatically brightens the face to compensate for the black, making the face over exposed and bright yellow, which doesn't happen on other platforms. Can't even think of adding a ring light. I haven't noticed this on the desktop version.	N	{'neg': 0.119, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': -0.4031}	-0.4031	0.119	0.81	0.071	N

Business or school: It is just right for video conferences, meetings, school- related meetings, & etc. Socially: It is a nice way to connect but also interact with other people. my only dislike is, it uses a lot of data, once data runs out, it runs very slow affecting the quality of the meetings.

My main issue with any facet of zoom service has always been poor user workflows. For example, the trying to leave a meeting when using the app if you are anywhere other than the main participant view is non-intuitive. Similarly, there does not appear to be a way to switch the audio to a normal headset/phone mode in the app, and dialing in to a meeting in progress is frustrating.

Whenever I unmute myself, I couldn't hear the other participants' audio when we are speaking simultaneously. What seems to be the problem? Is it my phone or the app's malfunction?

It does what it says, the UI is still messy though with options here there and everywhere in or out of meetings. One thing I should add; the app description says virtual background has been added. This is true, up to a point - two handsets here, same app version installed on both, and it's available on one but not the other. Whether the difference is the chipset (one handset has SD, the other does not) or something else though who knows, hopefully future updates will tell us.

Ok ok app... Gets disconnected often but one thing is that it connects itself and not like Google Meet that we will have to enter the code again and blah blah blah....but please look before you leap... So, pretty good app better than Google meet. I have edited this after 6-7 months of experience, in my first review l told that it was a very bad app, but it turned out to be a good app and also, it is FAKE that it's security is not reliable, but after using it for 6-7 months even, it had NO issue.

I used this app as an online classes for my school. Bt since yesterday the app is being updated due to which whenever I go to the participants list or to any other web page my video automatically turns off.

Before it was updated, it used less data but now it uses alot of internet. Whenever you go to the participants list or other apps, the video reflects as off which is annoying. Sometimes the meeting gets disconnected and shows connecting even when the data speed is high. Make updates which use less data and video does not switch off while using other apps.

The problem is that if a participant has less data, he faces a lot of troubles.. moreover, it doesn't gets connected.. secondly, when I host a meeting in my PC, I change the settings to allow multiple participants to share the screen at a time.. but it never occurs.. only single participant can share the screen.. in PC, i can never share my screen of the zoom meeting.. whereas I can share it in a mobile..

Very best app for online studies but there is a trouble that the outsiders come easily in the meeting and disturb all the students which causes a great disturbance in the minds and concentration of students. There should be a feature of writing a list of students and the app will automatically accept them to enter and those whose name is not in the list they will be put into the waiting room then the host will decide whether to join or reject them .

This is a nice app. But here is time issue. After 45 minutes its closes meeting which is so irritating. On the other hand google meet has no time issue. So i suggest everyone if you need unlimited meeting time then u should use google meet. Unfortunately we all need unlimited meeting time. But so far i know google meet doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t support record option. If you need record the meeting and 45 minutes is enough for your meeting then you should use zoom meeting.

At the start of lockdown it was completely fine however when we went into summer it was draining our battery and making our devices hot. It kept on freezing and going echoey. There was once where it wouldn't let me in for a hour even though I had good WiFi. Lately it has been echoey and cutting out but I am not sure whether that is my WiFi or the app. Overall, it is a great app because when my groups can't meet for meetings we go on zoom and it works quite well for what we want to do.

Great sound great picture but some options that were lost with updates would nice to be an option again, but stay as a choice not automatic, like not allowing more that one person to open as host, no host keys and if you accidentally or on purpose you boot someone it should be reversible right away not 24hrs later. These things should still be options as meetings are different, and large, people are needed so things can functions at peak efficiency and some still need them for daily running.

I would say it's a good app but some things are not up to the mark and too much bugs, sometime it is impossible to use the app. And I would like to see some new features like virtual background like the web version of zoom. So think about it. And one more thing after each update it feels like they have removed previous bugs and added some more to fix later which is very annoying.

hi, after 3.4.0 update I can't annotate the right part of the screen when I'm sharing my screen on my Samsung Tab S7 Dex Mode. This doesn't happen on tablet mode but I use Dex Mode when I'm working. This issue didn't exist in version 3.3.5 so I downgraded my zoom to version 3.3.5 because I need to use the annotaion. Also If u realize that we don't have eraser tool in annotation tool when we're shaing our screen. Please consider to fix the issues. Thanks.

This is good and all But yes I have a lot of complaints for it.1 It takes a LOT of time to open up like I try to login 5 mins earlier into my class and instead it takes SO much time to open up and login that I get in the class atleast 10 mins late! Is this a joke or what?! 2 Whenever I try to share my screen the app closes within 30 secs of my screen share. Like why?? 3 Whenever I open any other app (like chrome) while in a meeting, I get disconnected from the meeting.

I like the UI from Windows where you can see 25 users at once. If you're casting Zoom from android to your TV that UI comes in handy even though not 25 but 9 screens could be possible I believe.

I like Zoom but one of the trouble spots is the permissions a co-host has. A co-host cannot setup breakout rooms while another host is managing other meeting details. Breakout room management, if you have to do it manually, is a huge job if you have a lot of people in your meeting, and it would help if the 2nd host could do it! Please change co-host permissions!

I only have a tablet to use Zoom on and it only show 4 people at one time, to see everyone else you have to swipe the screen. Being one of five it was ok at first as I could hide myself and see my brothers and sister, but since the update I can't do this anymore, so one of them is always on a different screen so it is hard to interact when I have to keep swiping backwards and forwards.

It works properly but sometimes when you put the right password it shows that it's wrong and you can't enter the meeting again because it disconnects, my disconnected many times but I again return to the meeting with no problem but one day i experienced the password problem and I asked my friend and she told me that this happened with her too.

I wouldgive this app five stars but I can't. This is a very good app but the problem is that even when I have full internet connection or even use data the meeting goes away and tells I don't have any connection. And also during the meeting, a writing comes telling that I have an unstable connection even if i have strong connection. This app needs a lot internet to go smoothly.

Fantastic interface makes so much possible, but quite a few problematic glitches. Layout inconsistent across different devices so things you need are suddenly not there-teaching hell. Zoom also changes layouts w/o notice. Pulls the rug out from under your plans. Teaching art requires multiple cameras making it necessary mute all but one sound device to prevent feedback. But you can still here munchkin voices no matter how hard I try. Its like a snipe hunt.	P	{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.785, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.6946}	0.6946	0.08	0.785	0.135	P
A year later and Zoom hasn't fixed this bug.... Love Zoom but there are some bugs. If you join or host a meeting from the Android app using VOIP 'device audio', if another call is received on your phone during the Zoom conference, when the phone call ends you are returned to the Zoom conference however nobody can hear you when you speak even though you do not appear to be muted in Zoom. You must leave the Zoom conference quitting the Andoid Zoom app and reload Zoom to enable the microphone.	P	{'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.93, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': 0.6249}	0.6249	0.014	0.93	0.056	P
It is good and is getting better the features and the overall service quality has gone up significantly since the beginning of 2020 like with smartsharing.

I don't like that some features don't work on all devices. Zoom works the worst on Chrome! You can't see your list of meetings from Chrome or save the chat to a file.. You can't assign people into breakout rooms from anything but a P.C. My audio and video work best from my android. But, overall I still give it a 5 star rating because most of those things are probably the limitations of the devices and not Zoom.

Needs a bit of work, such as allowing the entire app to remain in landscape mode, the audio outputs need more fine tuning; ie there's a speaker option and a 'quiet' option, what's with that? I'd also prefer it if the tabs in the 'more' section were all moved to the main functions bar, it feels cumbersome on mobile. Otherwise brilliant!

It's a really useful app, during this period especially. It's helping us to keep up the communication with friends&family. I'm using it for my Online Classes. There's one issue that, whenever my network crashes in the middle of the class, I'm losing at least a minimul part of my attending lecture. Technically, it's not the problem of the app, but if the developers could create an option so that i could get back what I lost regarding network crash, that would have been a serious helping hand.

Would be better if we could use the chat or the meeting settings while looking at the main screen, like in the Desktop version. And, for the desktop version itself, when I change the orientation of my laptop for the shared screen to look big (shared screen is a mobile phone's portrait mode whiteboard), the orientation of my video doesn't change. It looks like I am sitting on the wall or on the ceiling. This is a important feature that should be implemented. Zooming into a video or shared screen should also be available for online classes to be able to see all the details on the board, or in a shared OneNote, etc... As few online classes (like the ones I attend) only allow people with a particular zoom account given by the school, I would like to be able to record the classes to review them or to send them to an absent classmate. This would be extremely helpful. Other than these, a great app.	P	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.9824}	0.9824	0.0	0.822	0.178	P

Zoom has become a way of life during the 2020 Pandemic. It connects families, coworkers, students &teachers, and new friends around the world.

Although zoom is very good app for these school meetings but the only defect I found here is that it needs a strong WI-FI .

Good app for me and my way of doing things. I haven't used it since downloading the new update, but I would believe if there are any issues with it. The developers are already working out the bugs and would be sending out a new update immediately.

This is a good meeting app. One can easily meet with one another through this app and share his thoughts and ideas with the participants. This app has only one disadvantage that the meetings with 4 or more than 4 people ends after 40 minutes So I request you to please solve that disadvantage .

One of my kids is in kindergarten and even though the teacher mutes all the kids, they are smart and they unmute themselves.

so far so good. however, i have a little request; Can we have option to change the position of the gallery? currently my laptop (hence camera) need to be setup on left side of my external monitor, but zoom's gallery is always on right side of screen (far away from camera). So when Im looking at teammates while talking, the camera show im looking away(thus seeming rude). If I can set gallery to be on left of my screen instead, then i will be looking into the screen as i speak. Can we, pls?

Interface is quirky. Settings split between App and Website with no obvious logic. Schedular only inegrates with calendars if you set the meeting, invites cannot be imported. Video quality is generally good. Audio does not handle multiple voices/sound sources simultaneously well so forces stilted unnatural interaction. Cannot control individual sound sources, so you are at the mercy of the other participants' settings. You cannot reorder the vid layout nor customise the number on-screen.

The app generally works fine for lectures, but it's infuriating and embarrassing when it randomly unmutes you in front of the 100+ other participants.

Only one thing missing.Ã¢â€”â€ 1. Provide a handle to rotate the objects like line, circle, rectangle etc objects. Ã¢â€”â€  2.

Nice app for video conferencing. But the ZOOM needs to improve or update the muting process. As the host I should be able to mute and unmute a participant without them click on the it.

This is an excellent app and makes the world smaller. If you look at any of the negative reviews you will normally find that it is their hardware or the quality of their internet connection that is the problem. Despite working with so many different devices and internet providers etc, ZOOM usually works anyway. The controls are pretty intuitive. A great app. Update: Continue to grow their capabilities and is a very valuable connection during the pandemic. Was this review helpful?

It's just unique and very easy to use. It's got a really good quality even with the least updated tools and it takes just a click to get started amongst devices. It equally has nothing much to worry about once the internet supply is considerable. It's the ideal in my opinion. Thanks, David.

Hopefully I'll get more skilled at ZOOM meetings (I've only had 2). The link that was sent to me wasn't sent as a hyperlink so it took me a minute (or 4) to type in the necessary info to join the meeting. Not sure if that's a problem with my email, my service provider, the ZOOM host or just a momentary lapse. Quality of audio and video was exceptional.

Top notch. Works easily. Works well. Can offer at least temporary confusion to those who frequently skim content for actions, i.e. those expecting fully intuitive presentation.

I could almost assume this business and idea has been heaven sent to be a lifeline to the world, friends and family. BRAVO to all those working with the ZOOM company who make this avenue of communication available to us all- to the rich and the poor, the isolated and free, to those sick at home and in hospital, and those at work.

Zoom has turned out to be an amazing tool for AA and NA. When Covid hit, our little group, in a very small town, got on zoom immediately. Not only were we able to attend our own meetings but some of us started going to meetings around the world thanks to zoom. And now that we have just a couple of in person meetings a week l, we keep zoom on because addicts and alcoholics are reaching out and we want to be there when anyone reaches out for help. Zoom has definitely been a blessing.	P	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.204, 'compound': 0.9666}	0.9666	0.0	0.796	0.204	P
Zoom is absolutely AWESOME! We use zoom for our spiritual meetings, we have 6 meetings a week. Without Zoom things would be so different. With Zoom we are able to keep in touch with our friends & family. To really see their faces to make sure they are doing well. I would recommend zoom to anyone and everyone who wants to reach out & see their family in real time. Zoom has made this Covid-19 Pandemic a lot easier to deal with.

Zoom is a video-calling app that is ideal for large groups because it supports up to 100 users for free. It is widely being used for meetings, online learning, and university lectures, among other things. The app has become immensely popular as people have been forced to stay indoors due to the lockdown.1.If you're using the app on the computer, simply click on Share Screen which is on the bottom bar of the meeting window.2.You'll see various options here Ã¢â‚¬â€ under basic, you will be able	P	{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': 0.8807}	0.8807	0.031	0.823	0.146	P
Zoom is our lifeline for last 6 months. Iuse only the mobile app, so my views only based on that experience. Giving a 5, but following things could improve. 1. Android phones should also get option to create virtual background. I think its only available on i-phones currently. 2. On my screen I should be able to decide how may participants i want. Currently you see 4 participants by default. I should be able to change it.	P	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.883, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.8248}	0.8248	0.0	0.883	0.117	P

I have really enjoyed ZOOM since we went into lockdown because of the pandemic. It has allowed me to stay in touch with my friends and continue attend meetings with my congregation. I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and ZOOM has helped us with our meetings. I think we only missed one meeting since COVID began - and that was the very first one. Thank you so much for helping all of Jehovah's Witnesses to continue learning about our loving God, Jehovah and helping us to stay strong spiritually.

Connected during lockdown. My favourite app. Very useful in team discussion/projects and education, e.g. lectures. Can be used to facilitate project management but requires other software.

I can do meetings, chat, livestreaming and recording (only in desktops) and many more. The UI is also nice. Also after Zoom updated, it shows the data center you are connected to in meeting statistics during a meeting. New features are added and the app deserves a 4 star just the fact that the meeting experience is little bad with Mobile data but ya Mobile data gives you a bad data speed than WiFi but the app is guilty.

The video conference calls are clear on 4g lite. Even in areas of low connectivity, the narrow bandwidth hold the connection. The video is sharp and I'm able to see the host screen with clarity in both portrait and landscape mode. I'm even able to enter chat and view the number of participants similar to 10 inch table and 11 inch screen laptop. The best part that people always forget to mention is the ability to transfer app to sd card. Thanks zoom for that innovation.
