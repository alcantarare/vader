It is overheating my device, and it has audio issues. I was forced to use it for school. It was alright, worth about 3 stars, but now it's worth nothing. The picture quality is atrocious in low light. It also takes so much power, that my device gets really hot. There is also a glitch/bug that makes people on the other end unable to hear me. The only solution is to use my mom's headset. Overall the quality is terrible.
This may be a popular app for many people but for me it was absolute garbage. I have literally spent hours trying to make the sound work. I have followed all the instructions. I have turn the sound on in the app and make sure that all of the settings are correct per the instructions from Zoom. Force stop the application and clear cache. Restart the device. Clean up residual garbage with the CCleaner app. No sound. This app is just garbage
For the past few weeks, I am experiencing a major problem with this app. I would often get disconnected at times during a meeting, even in the presence of a strong internet connection. And it would not even reconnect by itself, and then I have to rejoin the class manually. It is a headache especially at times when the meeting has waiting room enabled, and the host has to let me in on and on again. Plz help , if anyone can fix this problem.
The zoom appears a black screen and says connecting to longer and then says your network is slow but my network is 4g.This problems occurs till 1 to 2 days.This problem again occurs in 20 to 30 days. My app is fully updated. Please fix this problem or say What I do? l reported this earlier also but I not get any response so.
The video quality has become very lousy, and since the last few updates, the internet connectivity has really been very difficult lately, and people have complained that they're having problems viewing what I'm saying with my signs. Either the screen goes dark, or freezes up or I get kicked out of my church service. Could the development team do something about this please? This is getting very frustrating for my deaf friends and I. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
Would rate 0 stars if that would have been possible. First off this app needs a very good connection to internet which creates all kinds of problems. Sometimes its not the connection fault its the apps fault like sometimes i have a good connection than also the meeting doesn't go smoothly. Try some other meeting app and avoid this.
I uninstalled this app before due to the hassles I have experienced just to connect a call. Often had to rather switch to a different platform. Now due to the unfortunate popularity of zoom, I have to make use of this again. First call didn't connect. I feel their meeting ID system is not good at all. This app should come with a warning that it might let you down.
My family had a virtual Thanksgiving, we were relying on Zoom and such a disappointment the audio would not work. We tried everything to get it to work and wouldn't we even tried a few hours later thinking too many people were on and still one of us couldn't hear and I was the only one alone for the holiday and when we all finally were able to get on I couldn't hear anyone's conversation and broke my heart. The picture was choppy as well. This was a horrible app.
This app has so many problems on my phone, it overrides current calls that I'm on when I'm on a cell phone call, it continues to ring after answering on my desktop, the Bluetooth keeps connecting as of in a call over and over again after a call is received whether I answer or not, it does not always show the missed call details, it will ring randomly for a call that was hours ago. Zoom really needs to fix how this program works on cell phones.
I'm facing problems with this app now! I had an account of Zoom in my previous phone but after changing my phone I added the same account too! But the problem is that,I am unable to listen anything what the host or participants say!!! This problem wasn't there in the previous one! I've tried changing the settings too,but it's not worth it!!! I'm using this app for my online classes and I'm unable to attend my classes since 2 days hence facing losses... Please fix this fast!!!!!
An awful app. Constantly freezing. Audio an issue, playback and niose echo. Sharing your screen is a joke. A waste of time. This app is a joke! I would give it 0 stars Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸ if I could. I won't be deleting or changing this review unless a proper update is created. this app has not been helpful at all
This is the worst app ever. I am having multiple problems with this app. 1) When I am attending my class, after just attending 10 minutes of my class my battery gets really hot. 2) After 30 minutes of attending the class, my battery will be 50 percent if I had 100 percent before attending the class. ( My phone is Galaxy m01) 3) Zoom takes up a lot of data. If I have a class that lasts 30 minutes or at the most 40 minutes, a message would pop up saying your data pack is over. I have 1.5 GB/day
When I updated it gets worst. But when I try to join it shows connection error and I am a student. I am not able to attend my important lectures . My teachers are also facing this issues . Try to solve it as fast as possible . It is getting worse day by day . Now when I join a meeting after video options it shows connecting and ultimately says that it couldn't connect .
This is very bad app It is very irritating to reconnect again and again . I have a very strong network connection but I can not hear the voice it break downs during the meeting .if there was.a option of zero star I would definitely give . And it can only see 4 people at a time so wanted more persons to whom we can see in on one screen.
I don't really recommend this app. This app has a lot of glitches which is down not let me in to meetings and more. This app is pretty bad to use, especially if you're trying to join a zoom meeting. This glitch I'm talking about is whatever I tried putting the correct passcode like 30 times it's always says that not the correct passcode. This glitch is really annoying. There are other glitches but this review be too long if I talk about them. So yeah I don't recommend
The reason I have given this app 1 star is the recent update since I have updated the app whenever I try to freeze my video this app automatically turns the camera off. Due to this I'm several times removed from the meeting. When I check the participants list it then too shows my camera off even if my camera is switch on
Very bad app. The first version was actually quite good,But the updates are slowly making it worse. There is always some or the other error or problem in joining the meetings. As a student due to these errors I can't join my classes and it frustrates me a lot,I am also far behind my course all thanks to this app Kindly fix these problems immediately
Terrible, unresponsive app. UI didn't work properly. Had to hang up and close out like 4 times just to get my doctor to hear me tell them my info so they could call me by phone. Absolutely do not recommend. Use discord or Google meet - they actually work. (Pixel 5, gigabit connection)
Lags way too often, I have to use zoom for educational purposes, it really sucks. Whenever I try to re-open the app for classes, it logs me out and unregisters me. It takes me an extra 20 minutes just to log in. When I get in the meeting, the audio quality is HORRIBLE. Everyone's voices pauses because of the lag, fix this, PLEASE.
The app was working fine until a couple of days back, then I updated it on both my devices and I'm stuck at the sign in stage. It's simply not functioning; I'm unable to sign in. It's showing a network issue constantly, but network is working fine with all other apps. Why only zoom and why after updating? Please fix this issue.
I've had this issue for a while now, My issue is that it keeps kicking me out of the app and in turn also my zoom meatings and I've gotten in truble so many times beacause of it so if they don't fix it I'm gonna screen record my next session and send it to my teachers because zoom is a no go at this point.
Awful experience There's lots of bugs and glitches and not because I have a low end device, I use a galaxy 10 and an iPad and still get kicked out and audio issues. One of my major complaints is how there's no way you can record your meeting on ipad or phone. MAJOR OVERSIGHT. I wish schools would not use this app. Would not recommend.
"l always get problems like when l am in class it gets disconnected. l always get this problems. We all the students depend on this app in the time of ""CORONA"".Our teachers take classes through zoom app.If someone does n't join in class then he or she doesnt get promotion .Sometimes if it gets disconnect and when l try to join again and l click "" Back to meeting "" it shows ""Connecting"""
I know it is a very nice app,but all peoples are facing problems of network, video quality sound,quality etc.But my problem is that when I on the video and goes in participant list,the video always automatically gets off.And also video quality is bad this my problems,so please give a new update for,next time I could give you 5 stars.Ã°Å¸ËœÅ Ã°Å¸ËœÅ  So please please please please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Âfix these issues for giving you 5 starsÃ¢Â­ÂÃ°Å¸Å’Å¸Ã¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­Â.....
I hate this damn app. Always close the meeting when the meeting is going on. Can't get a stable connection. Add more time limit. And i cant hear the audio neatly and also video is not also stable. Fix thisssss. And I always getting invalid email or password even if typed my password and email neatly worst app ever seen. I wanted to give half star but the option is not available.
I am using zoom app since the pandemic starts. It is very good app since the latest update. Before some days, zoom gave a new update I am facing a lot of issue. I on my camera but When I went to participant list my camera seems off. Because of this, my attendance for 10th standard is affecting. Please reply me and solve this bugs and problem as soon as possible because lot of students are facing this problem.
Some problems are there that make this app a little poor. 1) The device gets heated off very fast and battery drainage is also high. 2) It says to check the internet connection. 3) It is now usual to get out of the meeting.
This is really not a very good app. It is always saying 'an unknown error occurred'. And whenever I do floating windows or split screen my video doesn't come full. And whenever I go to the participants my video turns off. I'm sorry for just giving one star.
There's something very important lacking with the Zoom app... In Skype for example, I'm able to use my mobile with my notebook simultaneously, like, I use my Mobile's camera/microphone together with my outdated notebook keyboard (just for the typing if needed), and all of it in one profile... Everything works so perfectly with Skype that people have no idea that I'm using my mobile along with a notebook on interviews... Why can't zoom work this?
The worst app ever seen Ã°Å¸ËœÂ£. I've to use it due to its popularity, which is very terrible. It disconnects me automatically from the class. That sucks. I must have faced around 100 disconnects by now. Suddenly, it changed my settings automatically, signed me out even without asking. Wouldn't recommend. Ã°Å¸ËœÂ£Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€“Ã°Å¸ËœÂ©Ã°Å¸ËœÂ«Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¤Ã°Å¸ËœÂ  Just terrible! Hope I could give 0 stars. It doesn't even deserve a single star.
Useless app. It works fine but if you enter through lap or comp and you are not connected to data than you wont will be allowed to join till 45 min,it doesnt matter than if you connect it with data or restart your pc or lap. These bugs irritated me a lot. Useless app maker and developer and in new update if you go on other screen while zoom is Proceding than your video will be turned off automatically. Useless app
The vedios keep pausing. The receiving person couldnt hear my voice. Even there is full network connection it shows that the network connection is unstable. The audio of the opposite person keeps breaking and even sometimes I just can't hear anything from the opposite side even if the person is speaking something I've reported these problems several times but there is no improvement in the app. I prefer Microsoft teams app instead of the zoom app. Very Bad app .Needs improvement Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½.
It is a ridiculous and frustrating app. After the new update I cannot join easily to audio. after writing a mail they do not take action. I am a student and unable to join my online classes due to on mic it says join audio and after tap nothing happens.
If I turn my volume off then enter a meeting, I've done so for a reason. This app has no business turning the volume up, unasked, for no reason. What utter garbage. It's a fairly basic concept to ask a user before making changes to settings, since chances are the user set something for a reason. Garbage app.
Tried Zoom for the first time tonight for a quiz with a group of friends and it was dire. Video kept freezing. Sound was poor. Was unable to find the setting to allow all participants to appear on screen at once. Zoom abruptly stopped the meeting before time and a new meeting had to be arranged quickly to complete our quiz. And before you ask, I am computer literate and am able to operate most software competently and intuitively. Not Zoom. Uninstalling and will be going back to WhatsApp
Broke my camera and light Installed this 5 days ago to test another phone's audio. My backlight got greyed out from the pull down menu on the Moto z3 play and camera said error on the rear camera selfie camera only worked. In safe mode noted rear camera and light working. Uninstalled this app : boom, camera and backlight working again.
I started using this app from the start of the pandemic.Previously the app was good but after the latest update the was a problem. If I turn on my camera and view my participants list it shows that my camera was turned off. Due to this issue I was being kept in the waiting room.Please fix this issue as early as possible.
"Not happy at all... My mobile device keeps freezing in the middle of a Zoom meeting causing me to close my browser repeatedly. This is not acceptable...my position is ""remote"", so connectivity to Zoom and Microsoft Teams is imperative. Below are my device details: - Samsung Galaxy M30.uaing Android version 10 -Google Chrome - Microsoft Edge (latest browser Chromium) - iPad (iOS 14.2) Try to rectify this issue, as of now, I've uninstalled the Zoom app and now using MS Teams"
Make it so that the app respects the device rotation lock, cause even when it's locked in portrait, the meeting rotates when u turn the phone. Also please add support for Picture in Picture, so we can have the meeting visible while we open a document or something else. Add shortcuts when you long-press the app icon on the home screen. Make the navigation bar transparent in meeting
I am not able to connect... I report this problem but I didnt got any feedback... It shows connecting... But I am not able to connect... Pls do something related joining... It's really luck by chance app... If our luck then it will work or else not...i found one more problem my mic is not working.... Pls do something...
Worst app!! Hangs and I'm forced to use it Google meet is a million times better than zoom!! Why do I need to pay when I use ur app for extending limit!!? Lol! Just rubbish. Also lots of glitches and sound problem meeting is just worst! Pls don't download this and give it the worst ratings you have! Thanks for such a bulls*i* app!
Suddenly I can't login using my Facebook account. Access denied! Dunno why. I try to login with email and password. I forget my password because usually I am using my FB account. So, I used forgot password option. The email I received insist that I should login with Facebook. So stupid! And the support service always take so long (and no solution from the 1st time experience using it).
Whenever join, says network connection error. your people network connection is unstable and displays in ours. I too have a lot of screen shot saying your network is unstable. I am never able to join classes and not attend lectures just beacuse the error
Zoom is NOT user friendly! One time it sent me in a circular trip when I tried to join a meeting--from asking my password to having no active button on which to click back to asking my pwd. Another time, I was automatically joined, dunno why. Then, I was confounded by how to navigate within the meeting...all the choices meant nothing so I rattled around trying to be in sync with what the meeting leader was saying or showing some PowerPoint. Then, I simply was a fool and gave up.
it is too much in size 90mb is very big file that waste a lot of ram and rom .Every app try to show all in one but why.Each app try to make its video player,pdf reader, messages,audio call why.It does not porpuse of this app.there shoud be only video metting only.we use this app 2 or 3 time in 1 month.so user must be option like zoom lite or normal use.but there is only 90mb and use 300mb ram of mobile
I'm unable to connect the meeting even though my net is working smoothly. At first, I felt the problem is occuring due to bad connection but that was not the problem. I tried join the meeting more than 5 times... But alas! I was not able to!!! Please see into it as early as possible
Worst of all. I am a student.I am using this app for last 6 months.It has given me alot of troubles. When I join in participants list it shows that my video is off but my video is on,this happened in mobile.In my laptop, when I try to start my video it says that this program is not responding.It is such a irratating and not securitized so for me this zoom cloud meeting app get only a single star Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¨Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡.Very bad app.Please fix the problem.So please fix this problem that i can give it 5stars
I have been using this app for few months but there has some problems in it. Though I turned my video on and it appears on my screen but it shows my video is not on in others screen. So, my teacher is removing me from the zoom class. I had never given reviews to others but it is my first reviews with complaints. Please fix this problems fast.
The app overall is good, but I have a problem. Even if my video is on, in the particip ant's list it shows off. Its been happening for the past few weeks. Please fix it
When I need to create a account on it so I can create a meeting it doesn't allow me to I right in everything I asks me too but it doesn't allow me, the button just stays grey I can't click it, I do not know what it is so you just need to fix that because it really annoys me and probably a lot of other people
It did not ask me to set a password, then demanded the password in order to log in. It uses the hideous Captcha with the tiny pictures where you can't see if there is a traffic light or not. Not impressed so far!
Very bad for me I was in the meeting and it closed automatically two times and after that I tried to enter the room it was not allowing me to enter the room and showing that no space left. But I was already in the meeting and it automatically closed whats my fault . Today's my class have been cancelled and I will be marked has absent just because of this problem plz increase the amount of students at least abto180.
Zoom overall as a platform is ok, and I would have given it three stars. However their customer service and support is some of the worst I've ever dealt with for any product. Also the platform overall his incompatible with some interfaces on the internet.
Great app, but the gallery view on my Samsung Galaxy S7 tablet only displays 4 speakers, not the full gallery I had on my laptop. The app seems to think its a phone. If you can fix this bug, I'll happily give it five stars.
From last two days iTs annoying. I can't even join a meeting. They show me unable to connect. They ask in sing in again and again.
I am facing a lot of problems for some days. I am trying to sign in but it shows invalid password or email. And after that when I click any link to join a meeting it shows me incorrect password every time. But now i am facing a lot of problems.
I really wish my school didn't choose zoom for all the video chats. There have been multiple times where the audio didn't work at all and I couldn't hear my teacher, and sometimes it will randomly kick me out. Why is everyone using this? Pretty much any competitor has less technical issues.
Worst. It will ask me to log in despite i may have used it even couple of hours back. And the Murphy's law clearly plays with me as it will without fail ask me to re-login in all my important meetings leading me to a delay of couple of minutes. Sick of this now. Not exaggerating.
This app was good but I encountered an incredibly annoying problem. When I try to join a call, it says connect to audio over internet and theres nothing i can do to fix it. I called zoom support but they said due to covid we cant answer the phones. So if they fix this I will raise my rating but until then, this app sucks
I can't use virtual background in my Android 10 version. It is a main bug of this app because the number of Android users is the highest among smartphone users. So, this facility should be included in the Android version.
Very bad app. It is overheating my device.this can't remember my name for every meeting.This app's video quality is worse than any meeting app. This app hang my phone in every meeting.I am unable to join any meeting in zoom in couple of days,even my internet speed is in Mbps. If there is the option of 0 star so I can give 0 star to this app,but there isn't option so i can give 1 star. Overall, it is worst app,I have ever seen in my life.This is garbage for me. Thanks Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¤Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¤Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¤Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ  Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¤!!!!!!!
My video is showing turned off in participants list. I'am a student and I am using it for my online classes from the COVID - 19 Pandemic. Many of my classmates are facing the same problem I think so. So My issue is that the video showing that I turned off. That's the reason for the rating of 1 star. -Mugundh.S -
Very bad quality app i will never ever recommend anyone to download this app. This app caused me problem in my online classes my network is good but it still shows that my network is unstable but when i go to another app every thing works fine and worst thing is that because of update whenever we go to participants list video gets off. Most important thing is whenever i go to another app my video gets off. Older app was good.please try to improve these type of silly issues. Please zoom
I cant even sign up it constantly shows the message that you are not eligible for joining. This app was good but now it has became a pain in the ass. Please fix the issue or the ratings are gonna go way down.
Very bad experience. Issues with muting microphone not working, stuck in safe driving mode--and I wasnt even driving! I could see everyone at the party but couldnt participate. This was my Granddaughter's 2nd birthday. Very upsetting.
While using the application the battery is draining very fast , also it make the phone too hot very fast , make the phone lag ,My mobile has good network but than also it show please check your network connection , please solve these issue Otherwise it is the best app for online classes and meeting .
Dozens of bugs, no one can hear my voice and no one can see me even though I have my camera on, please fix this I'm a bit frustrated right now, also fix your website, I also encountered a forever glitch such as nobody can hear meÃ°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½
It is very good app for School Online Classes. It had good video and camera quality but the virtual background in my Android phone (Vivo V9) is not working and It is working in my another Android phone, Please check this issue and I have sent many reports on this. It is present in IOS and Laptops and more. The new update is amazing. There were only 2 reactions and now there are 6 reactions. The Dark Mode Support is very nice. Sound Quality is also nice. That's Why I rated this app 4 stars.
Since I have updated the app, there is a lot of problems I can't hear the audio clearly what other r saying and automatically it will be coming back by showing reconnecting. And even the video is on but for the host it showing video s off.. Not nice ap
Zoom should add a facility on next update which is lock screen while in the meeting such as we saw this feature on mx player while watching movies for avoiding unexpected touch on the screen....in zoom in the meeting period sometimes the camera or mics start on by unexpected touch && makes an uncomfortable situation....zoom should add this feature...If they add this...I will give 5 Ã¢Â­Â
Virtual backgrounds do not work. I have the proper versions of Zoom and Android, and an approved phone manufacturer (Samsung), but the feature isn't available to me. There's no indication of why it's not available, either.
Plz fix the video issue plz don't make the video off when someone leaves the zoom and in on another application. When we are having online exams the teachers are sending link to us and as soon as we are opening the link at chrome instead of video pausing it makes it totally off and for that teacher are scolding us to on our videos.... Plzz do something of it. It was good as it was earlier the video was still and the teacher was also not complaining
If I could give this no stars, I would. My wifi is working perfectly, but everything keeps glitching out. The audio barely works, and it's the same for video.
Very disapointing app we couldnt hear each othe then it dropped me. When I got back in, all they could see was the floor; very curoius since the camea is on the topbit will dilm the bottom. . Not remarkable in the least. Cant say how you earned a 3. 6 Rating. ...
The Privacy is worded so shadily I feel like you need to be a lawyer to understand this. Not only is it lengthy but the opt-out option is just text not a button to opt out. This make it very hard to trust the app/program.
Earlier it was a nice app but nowadays it has many when host ask me for unmute I am unable to unmute and when I am in full network then also the meeting disconnects automatically and the mobile gets hang many time so please make some features that can help to to use the zoom easily and and whenever I try to join the audio I cannot hear what the host speaking so please resolve the problem
Most of the time I can't get into my lecture. Sometimes it ends on its own. Mostly it's show report problem if we report there no change made in it.
From many days I'm experiencing gherse problems : when I get any whatsapp zoom invite link and I try to open that I get a launch meeting button when I press on that it shows the zoom logo and then it automatically comes back to where it started (launch meeting)
I have NEVER gone over my data limit which is 1 terabyte but after using zoom I have gone over my limit 3 times back to back. I have 4 smart TVs, 2 PC's, 4 laptops, 2 gaming consoles and 8 smart phones in my house. Someone is always doing something and we don't even come close to going over. Zoom is a data hog
I can't get the class.zoom is taking a lot of internet it need a high range of internet it is too hard to hear the classes. I think this is why people choose Google meet. please if you fix this you would be getting more people using this application. I hope it's better to you use app which needs less network/ internet.... please Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ»Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ»
Probably the worst app ever. Lot of bugs and glitches and always there is a video problem even if I am switching on my video in the participant list it is not showing what the hell. Would not recommend this to anybody. If I could give 0 star surely I would've given without even thinking once.
From last 3 to 4 days it is always showing connecting but it never connects. it is not connecting the meeting. Please solve my problem
All these apps are just really designed to record your your stuff you got to be careful there's a Green Dot on your phone if it comes on on the top of the phone a black circle when it lights up is recording and taking pictures be careful what you put on your phones and be careful what you give access to because they are recording you know some of these people are real freaking nosy
My Primary doctor tried callin me 5 times to connect with me. 5 times she just went to voice mail!!! It was a Very Important Appointment! Your Stupid App has caused me a lot of Trouble And now i have to Reschedule this Appointment!! I have Never had a problem before with Zoom!! I am so Pissed! Fix this damn problem!!
I update this app a day later. The issue is that when I switch on the camera it gets on but in participants list it's showing that the camera is off. So look through this issue.
This app is totally a garbage. It uses so much net and so much network issues in it is good to use in laptop but It can't be used by mobile. Whenever I use another app during the meeting the video gets switched off automatically plz update the app and bring some more feature like we can switch on our video if we use another app during meeting and we can set virtual background in phone also. It is just a waste. I hate this app because of this app my net gets over. I hate this app. Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
Bluetooth audio devices don't work with zoom on android. There is an icon of a volume speaker during the call that turn into bluetooth mode when tapping on it, unfortunately and it's a shame for such app, nothing happens when tapping on it, suppose to switch audio to bluetooth audio device, but doesn't.
There were issues and customer service was not easy to contact in a timely manner. My daughters wedding was supposed to be on zoom and due to issues that support was unable to help with in time, the wedding was unable to be broadcast as planned and everyone missed the wedding. And its very bad
I love the app but recently it's crashing for no reason with error code 5 and unable to resolve either for long time. My sessions are cut off. I'm frustrated please clear the bug.
That's not fair why Samsung Galaxy J2 Pro are not supportable to virtual background????? This is cheating with those people who have this phone. They can't even use this app advantages. And one more thing that it takes to much data I join only one meeting of 1 hr. and it take 1GB for it that's too much. I don't prefer anyone this app. That's why I gave it 1 star.Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡!!!!!!!!!!!!
Logs out unexpected Lages alot (my network is super speedy but still) No option to lower graphics for attendance The voices sometimes laging ( not about network nor phone) Consumption of data is high Claiming that space for the app only around 50~80 MBS but it reached to 190 Mbs
Very very very bad no-no wost app . I was kick out of the meeting although I didn't do a single thing. Due to its own bug this happen. If u can than use other app like Google meet or anything else. O star
While meeting when one participant receives call and when he talks on call that voice gets to everyone in meeting.so there is desturbance created.So I suggest zoom app developer to solve this issue.During meeting when someone picks his incoming call he should get automatically paused by app.after that he can resume himself manually.
Sin e the last 1 week,I am unable to join meetings smoothly.When I finally join,the video quality is heavily poor and the audio quality is hopeless.My wifi connection is very strong and all other apps on my device work smoothly except this.I loved this app before but it has literally tortured me in a week's time.Please do something about this because I'm losing on a lot of studies and have no other online meeting options...Thank You
I have been using zoom since the last 6 months... Whenever i attend a meeting, i mute my microphone..but it automatically gets unmuted after sometime..it creates a very bad reputation as the noises from my home are heard by the meeting colleagues..Please fix this issue.
My last request has been fulfilled I am quite satisfied with it . I request you to add virtual backgrounds and vedio filters which are already in computers. Should be added for android devices too. A kind request to Zoom.Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€žÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ»Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ»
Why I gave 1 star because 1. It disconnect and connects again and again 2. When we go to participants list video will off and when we go to see other apps during test like whatsapp video will off. 3. It has many error code occurred.
When update comes it is becoming worst for me .In participants group it is not showing that my video is on but it is on.And my teachers used to say again and again to turn my video on.Sometimes they send me in waiting room .And some time they didn't allow me to enter I will be marked absent in the class and for giving annual exams I must get 65% of attendance.
This application really needs to improve. During online classes, the screen continues to turn off and on. Mainly, when I touch the screen or need to take a screenshot.
Wouldn't let you exited the schedule meeting after a lot of technical difficulties for no reason. Your just basically stuck until you have to undownlaod the app so many times. It gets worse every single day.
Am update for to make the experience better. I hold a paid account with you which I operate through my cell phone. Instead of giving more and better controls in the meeting like ability to make break out rooms through the app. You have taken away so many in meeting controls. This is ridiculous. Please get your act together.
Absolute horrible. I have a pixel 5 and the audio won't play back at all. Horrible horrible oversight to make sure their app doesn't work with one of the latest flagship phones.
One of the worst app. Cannot able to join meeting always shows Connecting,even after I am Having good internet connection. I complained many times still also this problem occuring.It seems like Zoom developer are not responding..
I am giving it 1 star because it has lack of many things. Sometimes, I accidentally send message to everyone.And I can't remove the message.
God this app is bad if you want to change your meeting name permanently you have to go through so many steps. The meetings are laggy at best. And don't get me started on all of the privacy problems if schools didn't force this app it would have only about 400 downloads.
Screen share option is not working, this issue is continuing from long time I also have reported this issue several times. I am using this app on vivo 1920 and facing this issue, kindly resolve this issue.
Great app!! Excellent for online classes or office meetings during pandemic.
Every meeting is a 15 minute comedy getting everyone's volume and audio working. The app should be able to guide usersin an obvious way to resolve this. Instead zoom expects users to use another device to google for solutions then fidget with them one by one.
My experience is very bad but it gets disconnected Everytime and it consumes internet too much and I can't change my profile picture. In the guide app it is showing another and in my app it is showing another and this app is not a 5 star app.Ã°Å¸ËœÅ¾Ã°Å¸ËœÅ¾
Worst app!!! unable to delete my profile photo in mobile, and poor video quality , unable to join the meeting recently after host removes us and as a participant i unable to see the whole list of participants joined . Hope fixed it ..
"cant join the meeting sometime. edit: recently im not able to join one class. its showing ""connecting"". but im able to join other classes. so i requested host to create new meeting id. solved the issue. when someone is frequently chatting, we cant click audio, video, share buttons. i think even developers dont frequently use the zoom."
Its awesome as you can share your mobile screen as well as your video you con connect with your friends and family by link. But main disadvantage is that you can stay with particular time period, then you automatically leave this meeting
We all were relying on zoom app for online classes.But the update made us all disappointed very much.Video gets turned off when we switch to any other thing even if we visit participants list.Please fix the bug otherwise your app would be worst as hell.
I am facing a major problem from few months there is always an error occur even having strong connection. I even reinstall app often but it doesn't work. Please try to fix it.
The meeting gets disconnect very often even if I am in the meeting it disconnects and the goes back to the meeting....... Very disturbing. I don't suggest this app it sticks alot even if the data or wifi connection is good. I hate this app I wish I could give zero stars. I wish to never use this app Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½
Zoom is a head ache. I can't sign up for zoom. Please don't download the zoom app. I will warn you it's a head ache. I have tried many times.But every time it says,Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am not eligible to sign up for zoom at this time.Ã¢â‚¬Â
I am facing a lot of issue. Whenever I am in the meeting, I get disconnected and its very annoying
Very poor app with bad updates which anyone doesn't want it. It takes lot of data and sometimes it gets hang and while joining from pc or laptop it takes way much time through which we get into problem. VERY DISAPPOINTED.
Audio is not connecting to bluetooth speaker. Till I open zoom app, bluetooth speaker is working. Once I connect to zoom meeting, audio is playing via phone and can not playing via speaker even bluetooth speaket is connected. its very annoying
This app is so trash. When I join a meeting using wi-fi it it gets stuck on preparing meeting and after a long time it gets completely stuck on connecting but when I join the same meeting with cellular data it joins without a problem.
It is not working when I click on sign in and always write zoom is not responding. It also doesn't connect to any meetings. This update isn't working on my phone and its very disgusting
I hadn't expected the network issue from this app but still it always shows network issue and always he break my heart. And this is a disgusting app ever there is an online class of mine at a time I start suddenly it shows that your network stream is not good...... Don't install this app ever................................................................. And when I report the problem the owner of the app doesn't take any action to sole the network issue problem
i have been facing a lot of issues like the meeting does not connect it keeps on showing connecting.... But does not get connected.
I'm not like this new version of zoom. Because, I'm cannot minimize vidio by exit from this app. If we see participates names, the vidio will stoped automatically. If we zoom our vidio, after stop it than second time we start vidio aur start automatically the vidio is not zoomed as we did. As it is some fault in this in it.
From the past few days I have been facing problem in joining the meeting with this after updation of the zoom app. Then also it is not working.
I've not been able to log in for days. Neither on the app not through Google. Connection timed out. When I try the feedback link in the app it says can't send message. Weird and felt sad.
Please develop some of your bugs. We are facing Unnecessary problems while meeting . For example in the participant list the video icon is showing off while in the main screen our video mode is kept in on mode. So we are facing this issue since 1month. Please solve this issue other wise tu behia muha marei ha salaÃ°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸Â¤Å“Ã°Å¸Â¤â€ºÃ°Å¸â€˜Å Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½
Devs fix the problem on this android version. I can connect with ios, windows version with no problem but this android version is not working as intended. I can't connect to a meeting even the passcode was correct.
Won't allow the option to use audio. Can't change option under general settings. So I can see, can't talk or hear others. Don't have this problem with TEAMS.
Flawless video and audio? Huh, you guys are totally not lying! I mean, I saw MYSELF lag in a meeting, and I can't hear other people properly TOTALLY FLAWLESS ZOOM, TOTALLY NOT OVERRATED, AND TOTALLY NOT A SCAM. It's so flawless that the only way you can protect your meeting from hackers is by using the annoying waiting room system that takes 10 minutes to refresh! So flawless that I was late for my important class and would have failed!
Virtual background is hard to set up, although computer met the minimum requirements,but still can't set up virtual background without green screen function. Weird and felt sad.
Very irritating app never let me attend my class and has a big role in creating backlogs in my studies....Do something... It always shows a error msg whenever i trid to attend the meeting My internet is good enough,,no issue in my internet...
I don't like this app because. When I am having a live class the video and audio is not working properly for me and my teacher
After the last update no one cam hear my audio although my mic is working Corry but zoom can't take the input although I have a descent phone and internet connection
earlier it was very good app.... but after its last update.... it was the worst.... screen sharing freezes everytime .... it's too much irritating.... 1st of corona and now this also making us to suffer alot...
This app sucks it always gives problems and do not leave us in and today I missed 3 classes because of this nonsense app I would like to give if there was 0 and even my internet was so excellent that I could download 1 GB app for just within 20 minutes and your app takes more and more net and if you don't do for the next app neatly the bugs. This app is the one which irritate me. If you guys don't know how to create app do not create.Ã¢ËœÂ Ã¢ËœÂ Ã¢ËœÂ 
Uncountable problems: 1. Battery drainage 2. Disconnects and connects automatically in midst of a meeting 3. Poor audio quality 4. Poor functioning in general despite a goid internet connection. 5. Host can see private messages 6.Cause of whatever academic loss I'll have
I don't know why whenever i sign in zoom after 5-6 hours it gets sign out by itself Before 3-4 days before i signed in morning and it got signed out by it self in afternoon.
Im trying to sing up and every time it says connection error and now im trying to conect to my class by using the link and from 15 min it showing error, such a waste aap fix this aap or make it working, i reinstall it 3 times restart my phone 3 times but still showing error waste total waste .... Ekdam ghatiya h ye. Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
from last one month its getting disconnected and it always shows connecting and now whenever I join in the meet it will be disconnected...
Only one star !!! Facing a really big problem ! When I try to join through laptop with full 1.5 GB net, its reconnectingÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¤ When I keep my video on, Its not showing the video it in participants.... Very dissapointed...Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¤
"This app is one of the worst app for live video conferencing. Whenever I operate this app it show ""connected"" and disconnected automatically within few minutes. Not ideal for students and passionate tutor."
I had a worst experience with zoom...I can't get into my class because it takes more time to connect eventhough there is no problem with the network...This app is just a wasteÃ°Å¸Â¥ÂµWhy you are taking this much time for connecting in that meet?Ã°Å¸Â¥ÂµSuch a waste appÃ°Å¸Â¤Â¢
Awful the audio sucks and sometimes it doesn't even work cant work if you have a Bluetooth device connected with it and then if you do it'll make the weird sounds and then to top all that it crashes like every 20-30 mins
If net is slow the meeting is getting disconnected ,and there's an another issue when I want to mute my self the video is getting offed and when I on my video it is getting unmuted
Bluetooth speaker gets disconnected when zoom meeting is connected. Though we see Bluetooth speaker is paired to phone, audio is not diverted to bluetooth speaker, phone speaker is used. But I can see Bluetooth symbol in zoom audio icon in meeting.
Worst app in the world I have been never see this like worst app when I am joing in any meeting my signals upto 3,4,2,1 pin I will keep for network and when I join in meeting it shows me; your network bandwidth low ; it shows and it will disconnect the meeting and also this will break the voice and it will stucks the video so I will hate this app
This very bad because It is reconnecting many times
When I attend a metting in between there is a call and when I pick it up and I declined it the zoom stars not respond or I will not hear the voice of host or who is speaking and sometimes it shutdowns my mobile plz fix these bug or glitch
Can't hear the host voice at all even after having full speed internet.... Problem not cleared how many times I was checked it and checked all the settings and permissinss of app even though can't hear host voice it is very problamatic for online classes
Very bad app ..... This always create problem You have to look on its connection problem .... This app also lack very much ... But it help me in this lockdown very much .... So for that Thank you for creating it .... But please improve its bad area...
"Very bad app, I have logout, trying to login with my gmail it's taking me the same page ""zoom-sign in"" that's about 30 min I couldn't attend my meeting after about several times of trying I finally logged in -THIS HAPPENS FREQUENTLY."
Zoom does not use Bluetooth earphone's microphone.
Very bad app keeps disconnecting continuous. And sometimes it gets automatically closed and we are out of meeting,so I refer please do not install these app.
Even 1 star is so much for this app cause it lacks everything including video quality, audio quality, chatting issues u can't add two accounts in the same app at once, most disgusting app ever don't even think of trying it just for once...
High ping due to Poor server connection as well as app crashes frequently. Though you have a mobile with 6gb ram and 100mbps wifi it freezes out and is absolutely worst. I recommend Microsoft teams instead.
Bad experience because this app is not working on my device and when I posted my review it has been deleted. What type of update has happened that suddenly it's not working on my tablet.
i don't why but this app doesn't let you switch onn your video. i thought it'd be happening with me just but i re-downloaded app and the bug stays the same. very inconvenient.
It is not working properly There is no option to change background My kids are very small they will not keep room clean so I thought in this background option is there na And I checked in internet means it came join in own meeting and search for option background but I checked means it is not there that's why I am giving 1 star
Idiotic app. It doesn't allows auto join after getting disconnceted. Controls pathetic. Consumes a huge amount of data. Audio video not clear even in high network speed. Heavy RAM and battery usage. Just one word to say- WORST !! Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€“â€¢
I've never had any sound. We have visual but no sound. My Doctor disconnects and calls me. I can't afford a computer. I try to do this through my phone but no luck so far.
I cannot hear audio at all. I have even checked if there is network problem but no then to i cannot hear audio.
Very bad to use for meetings . It sucks battery power , data and also shows so much complications while joining a meeting , a lot times it shows that password is incorrect .
On the other hand zoom is horrible and very laggy, it lags a lot and I have to wait 5 minutes to get out of the waiting room and its very bad.
This app drains too much of data and battery. And also I can't see my video preview during screen sharing.
"Due to this app my all classes got missed it always showes me "" AN UNKNOWN ERROR OCCURRED "" I dont have any network issue. I even changed my mobile phone. Plz fix this problem as soon as possible..... So that i can continue my studies in, at this time i am in 8 class so my each and every class is very important to me even a single class make me lost much of my studies nd due to this application i won't be able to answer all my questions in my online examination plz do the needful........"
Only one star because this app doesn't show that the video is on because when I start meeting I have seen that in participate it's shows that video is off but then I go back to the teachers face then automatically shows that video is on this problem is there in zoom only this problem I think I should give only one star
My experience is not at all good... As I am suffering a lot with it my teachers always scold me as in this my camera is always on but it always show off when I turn into the participants.... List is always off.. That's quite bad and I am a lot depressed with my exam how to sort this problem....
The worst app ever used. The features are very bad. Goggle meet is much better than this. Please use Google meet instead of zoom. In zoom app even if we switch off the video still it shows what we are doing. And the clearity of the audio and video is very bad.........
The worst app. Don't download. The signal connection frequency of this app is so weak that sometimes it becomes very difficult to understand classes.
Past two-three months the app has stopped working in my WiFi network. only this app is not working. This kind of issue is not expected from an app like this which is being used worldwide.
Before, I liked this app but now I really hate this. Please upgrade and fix your messenger appÃ°Å¸Â¤Â¬When I'm going to open my account on messenger, my account automatically logged out. Ã°Å¸â€˜â€°Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸â€˜Ë†
One of the worst apps for online meetings. When I used to attended my online classes, it was very often that my screen used to disappear at once. I had faced many problems with this worst app.Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½
There's a lot of problems.But one of the major one is getting disconnected and it happened a lot with me.
it is worse as it sometimes connect to meeting and many times not I have missed many classes due to this app as it doesn't connect to the meeting, only showing Connecting with black screen. It is worst !!!!!!! Why? Can anyone solve this problem Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¨Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¨Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¨Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¨Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¨Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜Ã°Å¸Â¤â€Ã°Å¸Â¤â€Ã°Å¸Â¤â€Ã°Å¸Â¤â€
App won't get past 2FA using either a code from Google Authenticator App or a Phone Text code - Pile of poo!!! I can log in OK from a Windows PC using Firefox, but the Zoom App on this Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 - not a chance! - Uninstalled.
Needs to change software system. Eventide i login to a meeting, asks for connecting audio through different options. The password is terribly annoying and not necessary.
"Doesn't let me to sign in using ""sign in with Google"" option on Android 7 tab. It takes me to select Google account page, and once selected, takes me to a page saying launch zoom. Pathetic"
"I wish there's a floating ""RAISE HAND"" icon, instead of opening the list of participants. Having this available for participants will make it easier to answer."
This app is really irritating. It consumes a lot of my data. I didn't even joined the meeting, it already consumes a lot. Very much disappointed.
This app is really peculiar. It signs out after each meeting itself, even though I don't sign out. I have to sign in again and again.
It has so many glitches in it Even when I have a good internet this app shows that I have a low connectivity This app is not good for students Students are not liking it I can't keep two meetings at the same time!!!!
I have been having a issue with zoom on andriod, not sure about Ios, the problem is with audio when I join a meeting I can't even hear the speaker or anything, please fix this problem for andriod, thank you.
When we on the video and goes to participant list, there it shows that video is not on. Please solve this problem. I have suffered loss by this problem,my teacher doesn't mark my attendance because according to them I have not turned on the video but it is a system problem.
I was late to join a meeting but it showed the meeting hasn't started but my teacher always come on time. After 5 minutes I asked my friends and they had joined the meeting .The meeting ended and I didn't joined it , I tried a lot but it showed each time to let the host start the meeting even after it endedÃ°Å¸â„¢â€š
"Remove the audio joining animation message ""call over internet"" its still confused me, i try to connect audio it take 1 houre and i don't konw how to join audio remove the message""call over the internet"""
Though my video is on ,in participants list my video is constantly switched off ,all staffs asked me to on my video and scold me for ur software issues .first it works properly but now if I on my video ,it only shows my face in gallery view but not in participants list
The old version was good but the updated version has a lot of bugs.. the video icon turns off in the participants list even I kept my video on this is a major problem for everstudents , and for this I hate this app.
This is worst app for meetings. I really used this app for about 6 months.But there is a bug that meetings are disconnect while classes are running
Will soon uninstall unfortunatly. Recent updates cause BlackBerry Priv to overheat and others hear my audio as a squeaking mouse. Several updates back this didn't happen. Will investigate Win10 or Linux versions on desktops.
This appp is dangerous! even after playing ff 3 hours my phone doesn't get heat but when using zoom for 40 minutes it get heated too much and drains too much battery.and no good audio or video. Videos are blur and audios are glitchy.
This is the worst app. I have to do my online classes daily but it shows network unstable I am not able to do my classes since last two weeks and all other apps like instagram and youtube are working with no issues but this zoom HORRIBLE. I mean how much network speed does it needs to work?????
It's horrible. I've been using zoom for the past few months and until last week, I'm on my meeting and I can't hear anyone in the meeting. The audio sucks.
When i join someone stuff after a period of time when i leave and joy back abd put they passcode in it says its wrong when tbe person didnt chang there password and its a bug that need to be fix if it doesnt get fix i would seriouly delete the app and give it a bad rating until then fjx tbe bug , Bye ! :/
Worst app.its fully loaded with glitches like kicking from class,some times if u enter correct pass code it shows its wrong.and many more like using more data or internet, using more charge of our mobiles.I don't recommend you to use this app
My several zoom class were missed because of problem of reconnecting. When class is running automatically it disconnect then i cant join my zoom class about an hour. Plz solve my problem
Very bad experience and would not recommend anyone as l am facing both audio and video problem and on complaining in the help desk I still didn't got a resolution of my problem .very worst experience with this app...
Screen Share option on my Android phone is not working I have tried all means but it's still not responding I deleted zoom and again install it But it's not working. Tomorrow is my presentationand I have to share screen and zoom just made me stuck...
It said in the official page that now android devices can change their backgrounds but I'm using a android 9 red magic 3 and it is not able to change the background. And also I'm using the zoom 5.4.4 . Please support because my background is mostly not clean and it is needed for school to have a neat background.
Zoom defines the major issues of virtual meetings: human beings are hard-wired for in-person connection, and no piece of technology will ever replace that. Zoom, you're garbage and will never replace even the most mundane company picnic. Zoom employees, please leave now and take your families with you as this corporation will be left in the dust of non-socialization, like Playboy and Gameboy Pokemon.
But from past 2 weeks it's doing problem.I typed the passward correctly a 100 times but it never ever worked. I missed 4 classes due to this issue
Fix it!! So i have my own meeting and i talk to my friends on it right and i make them host most of the times so i fell asleep and my friend oh was host at the time end the meeting and i tried to come back in and it keeps saying 'the host ended the meeting' when i'm the host pls do better man Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€™
Worst app ever seen! Automatically turns on/off the camera and microphone which we don't even do! Worst development structure of the app... Update it as soon as possible!
When playing youtube video at background the audio got really bad even when I'm not sharing the video and why it doesn't have option for decreasing volume for this app I'm taking about multi volume control.
I have worth it 1 star as the glitch of camera has still not fixed. Whatever the glitch is that we are shown that our camera is off in participant list though we turn on the camera. its very annoying
I did not use Zoom in my tablet for months then it will uninstall itself again and again. I will install it agin then it will just disappear.
Very nice for meatings but after latest update the auto connect is not even working i on the auto connect but i have to connect I hate this thing And one more thing please bring background change in android mobile every one can't affort i phone
Terrible app. And here I thought the laptop client was bad. Confusing layout, virtually nonexistent help, and takes way too long to even figure out basic functions.
Why i can't share my documents and screen in my phone? My phone is android 10 already and the app is updated already, i don't get it because zoom is very useful in meetings and discussions yet their's a lot of problem. So, disappointing.
Idk why bt from the past few days i am not able to connect my audio when in a meeting.. it keeps saying call over internet whereas i am connected to the internet when i open my own meeting the audio gets connected.
It's the best app I had ever used for video conferencing, But the main issue is battery drainage. I hour usage of it drains almost 10-16 percent of the battery percentage. So, plz fix this issue. Overall app is GREATÃ°Å¸â€˜Â
Cannot set up recurring mtgs on web client. Does not recognize start / end dates and times on recurring meetings in app. Assumes today's date and time for a recurring meeting. Basic functionality Zoom!
Took forever for the mute button. Hit the button on and off and still couldn't hear. Bad app.
There are lot of errors though I have a excellent internet service.Errors like error code 5 etc,interupts the meeting. Sometimes not able to join.It shows connecting and after 2 or 3 minutes it shows errors propably error code 5.
Always saying unable to open this app. I have to reset my tab in every one month to play this app.please help to reset this issue, as my child takes classes through this. Unfortunately he didn't take today's class due to this and I don't want to repeat it tomorrow
Worst app for classes. It keeps lagging. Due to this classes get missed. Plus when a meeting starts it only shows preparing meeting..and nothing's comes while others are in the class..pls fix your bugs else it would get such reviews only.
This appbis giving me hardtime..i cant see the video at all...zoom needs high sppeed network..but half world uses mobile data...please respond to my comment i have veen reporting this problem since lockdown started in march
It just sucks. Video is bad sound is INCREDEBLY BROKEN and more. Zoom listen to the ratings and fix its goddam internet issues audio and visiuals. Until then its getting 1 star
40 minutes time limit is worst.So, students have to lose important lectures and informations.Increase meeting time or this app will lose its popularity.
Now,i can't even sign in to Google/Facebook,,it only says error and incorrect password/email,,,,,i tried like*100 times*,,,but I Couldn't!,,,,, This app should be banned....Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¬Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¬Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¬Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ 
I am not able to hear the sound of YouTube while using zoom. Facing this problem since over a month. Fix it right now. Ã°Å¸ËœÂ 
There is a glitch today!! Zoom gave extra timing without paying for premium of zoom. I don't know what happened. Please! Don't do this!
It was working properly for me but recently it became useless. I am trying to enter my class but it just shows preparing meeting. My network is so fast but still it doesnt work on a 4 GB ram Phone
The newest update is trash, I can no longer sign in by Facebook and UI is seriously broken, not to mention the stupid reCaptha, I've to go through everytime zoom logs out
after i update to the new version, my zoom can't connect to the audio. So i can't to hear and interact in the meeting.
After updating the app ,this app has become worse than the previous version because even when I enable the auto connect to audio feature, it doesn't automatically connect to audio and even when I switch on the camera, in the participant list,it shows that the camera is off in only case of my device (Samsung Galaxy M30s).
After last update, Join audio not working, it is stuck in call over the internet,
It is a very very worst app when I am in the participants list or chat it shows your video is off even my video is on then Mam will scold me that your video is off this problem is from then when I updated Zoom very very worst app if I could I don't give 1 star also 0 stars Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
So many bugs, cannot able to connect to the meeting sometimes and cannot host, the lots of bugs also coming along with update
One of the waste app i never ever seen because of this I have lost my classes 5 times and it's lagging more. I gave them 1 star because it's good for the user to use paid version
Zoom's ok But, y is the virtual option not available for phones and tabs? And y when i m going in participants list it's showing my vedio's off where as it's on? Also that as much as updates v do the more and the more the systems are going slow and worse off!?!?!....Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¦Ã°Å¸ÂÂ»Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â„¢â‚¬Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ËœÂ¹Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€¢Ã°Å¸ËœÅ¸
Can't sign up, constantly showing that you are not eligible to sign up for zoom at this time, from a week
I hate this new zoom update in my ipad why , this zoom update make me so angry that i cannot talk while they call my name zoom plaese make a update of old verision please!! Zoom make a update that the zoom is not hanged in device ! I rated five starts at first and now this update came and i rated only 1 !!

There is no clear less of video .....And there is no audio quality also!!!! Please make sure this l!!!!!!
Its not connecting properly. Although i have proper internet connection . But it is showing cant connect to our service. The worst app i ever used.

i had a very bad experience ,whenever you switch apps,or go to the participant list, the video in the participant list turns off, even if you are in the app it shows off
There is a glitch. the zoom audio will lessen and uncontrollable after a call. And you need to restart it to normalize volume.
Useless app.... It is designed just to bother students and to waste their time, it is still good for office work but it is absolutely useless app for school and college......I will not rate this app...............(0 stars) Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸......Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ ......
After updating the app now i am not able to join the audio automatically and if i send message to someone personally then it disappeared automatically from chat box and my video turn off automatically if we enter in chat box and participate box
Its not that much nice but better this app must improve so much. Even me found the same problem what joshua AK found , and even i missed my class which i should be havind to be done in a very important role.find solution for it And sometimes i can't hear other's voice in this app
Showing Connecting....... Sometimes I also leave in between for no reason. My studies spoil due to this.
It is not showing my video is on in 'participants' though it is on actually and is visible to all... This is happening again and again.I reinstalled the app still Im not getting the problem.
The problem is voice is not coming and I am not able to hear anything.
Excellent Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’ app for education and also for buisness meetings, fantastic, thank you developers for developing such a great zoom meeting, One question- what is cloud meetings ? They have not given me answer so, or else first I have given 5 stars.
It's hard to get audio in computer and I have to download it when ever I want to Open meeting such a worst app in 2020 And my phone has super fast net but but it always says ur net bandwidth is low in computer it's completely worst
Not amazingÃ°Å¸â€™Â© this connection problems Didn't create one room. google meet is goodÃ°Å¸Â¤â€”. Zoom not goodÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¡. Change not backgroundÃ°Å¸Å’â€¡. Their also google meet betterÃ°Å¸â€˜Â. Very very very bad zoomÃ°Å¸â€˜Å½. Zoom is Ã°Å¸â„¢Ë†Ã°Å¸â„¢â€°Ã°Å¸â„¢Å 
Very worst experience with ZOOM app. Most difficult interface, not user-friendly, difficult to set as compare to similar app in Google app store.
Very bed ap . When you open this ap you are in condition because the settings is very poor .need improvement . I give only 1 star beacuse there are not any option to give (0) Star . don't want your time
Ã°Å¸Å’Â Zoom does not work anymore. It takeS between 40 minutes to over an hour to make a single connection. What a waste of time zoom has become. Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½
The Audio & video quality , screen sharing , and joining meeting was a problem I can't use this app at all everytime I am trying it has an error
It shows me error code even I have best phone and a good connection. I cannot connect to my meeting ever. Please fix this.
Sir even if I am switching on the video it's not getting on and it sorry it's saying to on this video, even in my other phone it's not getting on, so please really check about this problem.
From several days im facing prblm in when I get out from this app the meeting is get automatically disconnected . Wrost experience about this app. This update is worthless...
Really bad. Unable to sign in almost everytime. Had to uninstall & reinstall almost every single time! And missed classes too!!
After updating voice is not coming and video is freezing and my phone is hanging and my school classes are going on in zoom
I turned on 2 factor authentication and now the app won't log in, it just says 'please wait' indefinitely. I can't even get in to turn off 2fa.
Very bad app. It shows connecting in every 5 minutes, after 2 or 3 minute it shows can't connect to our service.
This is a very nice app .it really helps on school and work during this period. It has great quality . Again awesome app
Very bad experience. .....whenever i has to join any meeting it just tells that there is error in connection although my connection is alright. .....very bad...experience. ...
Recently I log out from my account on zoom by its app and now I cannot sign in.because I cannot remember the password which I put to the zoom signing in..,so I tried pressing forgot password,and I entered my email address and I got a mail and I pressed it but that also says I need to sign in to change my password.so how heck am I supposed to sign in without knowing the password and also I have tried the Google andface book
Very bad app ever, I started the meeting every after one minute it is disconnecting. Please fix this in next update, very disgusting problem
"Extremely useless app,i am trying to sign in but it is showing every time ""you are not eligible to sign in to zoom."""
When i go out of zoom to go on other apps or google search it doesnt have the meeting audio in the background anymore. it's frustrating because i do multi tasking alot lol
would much rather just attend actual class, not good, many bugs, poor quality, disorganized. especially hard to join a zoom with an old link
A very bad app. Sometimes my microphone is on but nobody can hear me. I can't join the meeting at a certain time. Worst application in India
It always used to create problems for me, my video is on but that doesn't show in participant list that is on and even if we update zoom many times it will become more and more worse I don't like this aap Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½
I hate that I can't see more people. If I am on a tablet I should be able to view more than 4 video feeds. If I am on my phone it should still be my decision how many I want to see. Even if they are small.
Very bad because when I exit zoom or go to chat it turns off my camera, and the sound quality is bad and there are a lot of glitches
It is very good for phone but when it comes to pc after the update the bug for pc
Great app but the auto rotation feature should be taken out. There has to be an option to either switch it on or off
It bad app because I can't get into my meets. I use to just put in the code and password now its asking for my email. When I put that in it says not valid
I just hate this app Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ in my life I have did not seen this worst app ever and never the video quality is not at all clear and while sharing the screen we are unable to stop the share at a time. This app was created by the worst features Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡ and for the latest update is too worst than before Ã°Å¸â„¢â€¦ if we click on the participants our video is getting off if we are going to another app our video is getting off . Please change that feature please Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ» if we at another app our video should run. Okay Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
microphone doesn't work almost everytime, also the host has another meeting in progress even if you are entering the same meeing by the same individual.
Can't upload photo for Profile. Can't add contacts. Missing buttons for these actions or buttons don't work. Hard to believe this is seeing across Corporations.
"Why I can't make my account on zoom? Whenever I try to sign up the notification appears that ""You are not eligible to sign up in zoom at that time"" What's the problem?"
It's audio issue to join audio call over internet and then I do correct settings of call over network after that it's audio join issue doesn't removed I am very irritating when I doing my meeting
Virtual Background menu is not exist on this version
Always facing network problem in this app. All other apps work smoothly but this app always say that you are not connected to network
I am giving one star because I am having several problems after the latest update and most importantly I am not supposed to sign up it says that I am not eligible to sign up zoom but my friend is also of my age and she can easily sign up zoom even if I enter my parents birth information at that time also it shows that I am not eligible to sign up zoom
Cant share anything, share option is not working, plus whenever i click on Share button no pop up opens, can't share any thing literally pissed off.... Please do take relevant action for the same.....
Can't switch accounts. Can't raise hand if I am the host of a meeting. Forced to use the app in the narrow use case that the designers have imagined
Connecting issue,video & audio issues are very irritating. I am using this app for more than 5/6 months.
This is vry bad app . There is always vonnection prblm due to app . So, Bcoz of this reason teachers can't explain well and children can't understand. In this app update is needed for many unique function.
Complete trash. even with high internet speed, meetings get reconnecting repeatedly and most of the time the voice is broken.
Whenever I am going to chat box the video become off, its very irritating
It just stopped functioning after this update, and I am saying this after reinstalling and changing my password and all I could the possible ways.
Worst app , it takes a lot of time to connect . I also checked my internet connection and that was right. Please solve this issue as soon as possible. If you do not heal soon then my study will lose.
"There is a bug in the application today. I ended a meeting. Then I wanted to start a new meeting on the same I'd. But it continuously shows that ""the meeting has ended by the host."" Now I can't start a meeting on my I'd."
"This app contain viruses i installed it in my pc it starts hanging when i show it to a pc specialist it says that "" oooo, it contains virus my 214 important files was deleted and my all pics got deleted and my phone has stopped wrking so i bought a new phone and activated my account again my pc crashed please dont download this app"
Please don't switch off our video camera while using other app in some conditions we have to use other apps then you switch off video camera , please don't turn off our cam while using other apps
If we are using the another app while zoom meeting if the network get slow down it suddenly come to zoom and another is closed if we ate writing an important part of will be deleted from the zoom
When this application has required to update then it have duble net more than before. Ã°Å¸ËœÂ«Ã°Å¸ËœÂ« All time my 1 gb net finish within 2 hour. I hate this application updation.
Worst app i have ever seen in my life. Whenever we do our meeting and the internet is also strong but the meeting gets lag everytime worst app i have seen fix these problem! Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¬Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¬Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¬Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¬
I am using this app this app was working proper but after new update thay can't connect audio I am click many time and And I click settings and select auto connect audio but that are not working proper
The new version is not good because photo becomes so big in this . The old version was good .Please improve this app or upload old version
It doesnt works on wifi...please solve this issue...but it is a great app...i will give it five stars when this issue will be resolved
Always shows that the meeting password is incorrect, It always shows that the password is incorrect
The password thing is not working and this is very disappointing I want to play among us over a zoom but I can't so can you please make the system a little bit more not this secure.
It stopped working atleast 20-25 times in an hour. Such a bad experience! It kept getting disconnected & reconnected of its own
This is the worse app I have ever seen its doesn't allow me to join zoom meeting. So I can't attend the class. Please fix this problem.
Very very bad experience... Very bad app I continously faced the problem of mic and sound, very useless app... Please fix this problem immediately
Keeps Getting Disconnect When Internet Good -and have to spend 5 to 8 mins in Connecting Screen- Audio problems- (happens everyday) I hate this app, failed an Exam because of it
Buggy.. screen glitches alot since I installed it. Only way to get it off your phone is through the play store.
"The worst problem of this application is that *"" it doesn't shows the video better it's video quality is worstÃƒâ€”Ãâ‚¬= worst into value of pie(22/7)""*"
This app take more data and battery when the zoom meeting is end the battery is very low and the audio quality bad it take a lot of internet
It is very worst app because it always disconnect it every 5 min it take update and it have very worst voice and when i write e mail id or passwords it always show incoorect
This app is very useful....but,, the voice hearing was not clearly to me that is the problems in zoom appÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¡
No volume up down Only at 1 level and also video turns off when participants list is opened so my ward has to leave the class meeting and he faces alot of problem in coming up with the classes. Please fix this problem
Definitely the worst meeting app, such a bad connection. I never have any problems with MS Teams!! Zoom, sort yourselves out!!!!
The new zoom problem, is if you use zoom phone and the call is listed at a notification, and not primary on the screen, you cannot answer it
Not impressed, my meeting was cut-off after just 40 minutes. Super upset about that.
New version of zoom is rubbish(5.4.4) if I use any app in background the meeting gets ends automatically , plz see to it this version 5.4.4 is garbage
It is a worst app. It takes almost 2.73GB data.the phone become too hot and turn off .A bad app ever dowlonded It is a data eating app. I will not give the app atleast one star Ã°Å¸ËœÂ£Ã°Å¸ËœÂ£Ã°Å¸ËœÂ£Ã°Å¸ËœÂ£
very bad you want to fix the main bug if participants are switched on the camera does your application shows as not connected the video please fix this problem
If my videos on during the meeting but my video is showing often the list of participants and whenever I back to any other App my video show and this problem is happening from my last update
Don't know why after update when join in a meeting no voice at all... I can't hear my friends voice, they can't hear me as well...
Hii management of this app, I want to say that the app is not working as per as data (internet) speed. Please do something about it. Otherwise I m very disappointed.
Not working properly .Always shows low network issue even ,i am always in full network . Fix it .I can't connect to meetings becoz of this issue
They did not reply to my complaint. I couldn't run zoom on my mobile data. It's been month I can't use my app on mobile data
For the past 2 or 3 weeks i have not been able to connect to my classes despite strong internet connection.That has made me update many times but the problem has continue!!
This very bad I'm getting disconnected Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­ again and again. I'm not able to do my chess class!
It's the worst app in this category. The camera is really buggy.
Vey bad. If I go to another app the audio does not come and the video stops. The meeting disconnects. Vey bad app don't download.Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
There is so many glitches first the opening screen in not sharing and 2ÃƒÂ±d the audio was not coming and third my video is not seeing by my classmates
This is very bad aap in my opinion...but these days this helps a lot ! Bad: because we have screen sharing problem,,, then audio problem then video problems...in this aap that's why I'm saying bad to this aap!!!Ã°Å¸Â¥Â´Ã°Å¸Â¥Â´
"When I enter my DOB A message appears and it had written that :- "" You are not eligible to sign up for Zoom at this time ."
App update: approx 9.11.20 Why ? Oh, why? Do they keep mucking about with this app. It just got settled on my laptop and was working fine . Now I can't raise my hand unless I go off screen, I can't see when others raise their hands ,unless I'm off screen, which is the very reason I started to use my laptop rather than a tablet!! For goodness sake! ....get it sorted!
Missed my whole meeting because of this app. We got in the meeting in time, but because the audio meeting is seperate from the video meeting, and the app does not give you any way to let the other participants know that you can not hear them, it was only the last two minutes of a 15 minute meeting where we were able to hear anything at all. Terrible app. Wish i could give it zero stars.
Unable to use share screen icon as host, I reported about this matter, still the matter is not solved.
I use this app on my desktop and it has a lot of video issue and audio problem so I can't hear .... u can fix it
When the host shares screen, He did not get the notification of someone who is to join. When the host will open zoom then only he can enter us.
Very bad app Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€™ inshot very waste app today afternoon I updated my app. Till then when I join a meeting I always need to click Ã¢â‚¬Å“call over the internetÃ¢â‚¬Â. Seriously I tried everything. It's a waste app.Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€™Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€™Ã°Å¸â„¢â€ž
It is not worthy of one star ratings also I donot recommend it for online classes it consumes so much data and the people using mobile data have to suffer its really a glitchy appÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€˜Ã°Å¸ËœÂ£Ã°Å¸ËœÂ«Ã¢ËœÂ¹
my attendance is going down as the camera in the participants list is showing off although I enable my video.the aap used to work fine before updating the app but after updating it the app has become worse.my attendance is going low .help me with this ..and make the app camera option beeter as before .MAKE THIS APP BETTER Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
Please provide mia3 phones to record zoom meeting we r getting problem to record the zoom meeting because while recording audio is not coming while conducting the zoom meeting please provide us some software or else the while recording we can record with audio also
Worst meeting app. It has mic cam glitch and connecting problems. The Microsoft Teams is better. Do not download this APP.Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
There are lot of bug...share screen does not load...high data consumption...mobile version is just useless...
Many times the video get disconnected.And there is a glitch that show my camera and mic is off this effect on my attendance.
I get disconnected, this has been happening for a few weeks, its irritating me
"It is saying ""unable to join, you don't have internet connection"". This app is not letting me to join my classes ."
Sometimes it seem some difficulty on launching meeting
There be option to share file in smartphones also not only in PC My auto connect to audio is not working
Without our permission it was rotation on its own mode even if the portrait or landscape mode is locked
I'm not able to share my screen. I've tried everything from uninstalling my app and installing it again.
I installed this app and started to signup ny new account but app is sending me the notification that I am not eligible to signup at this time! Wth I had missed my class! Resolve this issue and let me know!
I even can't connect to my online classes meetings. I tried to uninstall and reinstall still doesn't work at all. Still didn't connect to meeting.
Please resolve the issue of showing frequent connection issue after the latest update im not able to enter the app for my classes at all..always showing connecting and then comes problem connecting message .please resolve it.please do something.
"All I needed to say is "" MY NETWORK IS FINE BUT WHY DO I GET SO LAGGY?! "" . thank you for reading my review Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š"
Add shearing file on chat from android device. We can't record meating from android. But we desperately need this.
for first month it worked well but after that it showed error 5003 and 5004 and i am not able to attend my tuition classes as well as school.
This is a good app for online class..but I have settled auto connect to audio but this not working... please solve the glech......
I reallllllyyyy hate the new version of this app!just irritating! If we exits the video should not be stopped in between..Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã¢ËœÂ¹Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜
Doesn't Make sense. Whenever I turn the video on. It doesn't change in the Participants list after the last update... Very Disappointed....
Louszy performance app developers look into the app performance even with strong network.....the app is turning on and off itself their is huge disturbance in meeting... Thank you for the voyage... will quit sailing on your ship
When the update Sir coming version 5.3 it is offering my video if I also participants please solve this problem please solve teacher scolding like anything every time it will come out solve please on it
MThe volume can't be lowered while you're in meeting.
Total garbage, and I thought Teams was bad. No volume even with sound maxed. Minimal controls- basically just see other participants and that's it. Who made this garbage? Give up.
The only thing worse than the zoom app is the the zoom website. Why every school chose this as the optional choice for learning is beyond my comprehension.
Waste app ever to use because it was very difficult to use in laptop and it doesn't support old android version of you doesn't have a good network connection it is very difficult to listen in class please fix it and for more uses who have a very bad phone the zoom doesn't work and old model phone also it is not good for mobile
This app is trash.. u cant pin vid while viewing screenshare .. it always lags a bit while opening and so many basic features arent there... its PC VERSION is useable tho its not best... the mobile version is completly trash..
Very very worst and useless app i ever had becouse whenever i am in meetings suddenly after 5mins automatically it exits and says network problem please report.
I don't like this app.....it has very bad video clarity.... It always go back from the meeting n shows connecting.....
Weird, my phone keeps saying zoom has been detected using the camera, I'm looking right at the screen. Banned all permissions, to be honest I will probably just delete. Could do with an explanation devs? Anyone else had this?
The screen gets stuck on connecting despite the internet being fine and the app updated to the latest version
Can't mute self unless you join the call despite already suing mic. Cannot mute call volume all the because it locks to being on.
The problem is whenever we are minimizing app it automatically by default switches off camera pls solve this problem it's horrrible I am student and teachers are scolding me because of that problem. And the other problem is landscape and portrait mode whenever teachers are teaching us I always there's always an issue of landscape and portrait mode pls solve it
I had turned on my camera. But in the participants list it was showing that my camera was turned off. Its very annoying
This app won't let me sign up no matter what year i change my birthday . I also tried it in diffrent devices but nothing changes. Please fix this.
I had gave 1 Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸ due to the problem which i am facing 1: The video connection is very poor 2: The audio connection is also poor
This is what my school use. Unfortunately it is is bad. Sharing a video on a decent internet connection shows 1 frame per 3 seconds. The Audio is just unbearable. It is also very buggy. This is a complete money grab.
In this update there is no option to pause the camera when it minimize it automatically turning off the camera
Why free zoom time increase to 40min to 45minÃ°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡.I request zoom that decrease 45min to only 30minÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€¡Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¡plz my school lecture are boring and they don't realise that it is already 40min. They are not stopping and only teaching teaching
It has many bugs, if I turn on my video, it's not showing in participants list,and everyone says that they cant see my video
I am unable to share my screen using the app on my phone. I keep clicking on the share screen icon, nothing happens
Bad application, it just overall sucks that you have to pay for it to get more minutes. Discord is better, everything is free.
A lot of issues, sometimes, the network issue, or audio or video issue. All these problems are there despite my network connection is strong enough. And doesn't matter much either you update this app or not, it stays the same, and most of the times, it shows wrong meeting ID where I connect almost daily. Not at all satisfied with the service of this application. Adding on, majority of the times, 'server not found' or 'server busy' appears. Hope zoom resolves these problems soon.
Not accepting Bluetooth devices in many devices.I wased my money buying 2 Bluetooth headsetÃ°Å¸ËœÂ A very worst app...Google meet is better than Zoom meeting.First fix that problem.
Worst app for meetings. While online meetings , phone speaker wont work, only for zoom video calling, unable to hear..
Very bad experience. My meeting doesn't start at all. Having connection but not working.
In my online class we found some strenger people arrives everyday, When we try to join in zoom class, it's okay we need password. But how a strenger comes without accepting them. Many foreign people joins in our class and they makes hamper in our class.
This app has lot of connection problems. This app can't run on wifi.It always get disconnected when running on wifi.
Very poor connectivity. I have to conduct online class just now, kindly correct the audio and video connectivity fastly. Hare Krishna Sir!
This app is for the meeting but it contains many problems. I have to join the meeting but it was not connecting
I can't go through a meeting without it constantly logging itself in & out. I loose out of 3/4 of my meetings because of it.
Well connection problem, lagging, error. All of these happened while I have a good connection.
Camera sucks, video just goes off suddenly, battery died fast and shows error SOMETIMES when joining meetings.
1. It uses a lot of battery. 2. Virtual background didnt find in mobile phone. 3. I don't even like zoom. 4. In mobile phones dont have option of pause screen while we share screen. 5. Sometimes it starts disconnecting again. 6. It also uses a lot of internet. 7. When it update, it dont ask the user. 8. it had been updated our video will be closed itself.
"No call duration timer. No ""hold"" button so I can do other tasks while sitting in ""virtual waiting rooms"". Poor audio and video quality, regardless of internet or hardware. Leaving aside the fact that the pandemic has exposed an endless number of issues with network infrastructure, it has to be said. This app is worse than Skype, and people are only using it because they're forced to."
Very bad I suggest you don't download this app is world's worst app. I can't post this please read this review you can't join any meeting when I try to join the meeting my phone start hangingmy phones rate is 40000 and that's why it is hanging I instantly deleted this app and I told you don't download this this app is very bad meeting app in the world
It is excellenent meeting and conference app. But my auto connect to audio-after joining meeting is not coming from this week.please fix this promblem.
I always endure a problem with this app , when I attend my online class this app suddenly glitches and my meeting ends with a pop up with a code. Please fix this issue.
The app need to be improve many times it's automatically leaved meating It bothers me at all it doesn't care that it is good at half percent but bad as same as good.
Some features which working fine in this verison
Your software sucks it doesn't work with most of the laptops at school and has lots of connectivity problems.
I like this app very much But the problem is that as I update this app in the participants list it shows my video is off Please set the previous setting to this app I hope you will look after my review. Thanks.
Problem of audio choppy and distortion all the way Meeting time is to short Joining problem Disconnection issue All the way a horrible app
I can't change my profile picture it glitches and I know how to change profile picture in zoom but it just doesn't work!!!!
video and audio lags too much and quality is too low to understand anything please improve your video and audio quality and sometimes the app closes on itself it lags too much
I try to sing up it keeps on saying that my date of birth isnt legible even when I put 2005
The only problem in this app is i can hear others voice but others cant hear my voice this is realyy irritating all others was good
Rubbish it's just a daolr stoore copy of skype. it keep crashing and the video disapers or sound stops don't install
Its very bad I am unable to hear voice on any of the meetings... I even gave all the permissions to the app but also it is not audible.
Zoom is a good app Ã°Å¸â€˜Â but sometimes it hveissues like zoom doesn't allow the network to be connected just plz make more changes in app Thank you
Features don't work on Android tablet such as virtual backgrounds.
While meeting calling over internet 8s not workin l, tried alot to on vo8ve over internet but fail. No voice incoming or outgoing please fix it ASAP
The app is good. I have to use vpn for connecting
When ever I connect my bluetooth headphones zoom app is not working it is disconnecting. very bad experience
Audio and video transmission are garbled and breaking up. When I first installed Zoom it worked perfectly, and I was very happy with the app. Then the above problems started to occur. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. This didn't resolve the situation. I use this app. only for my School Classes, which mean a lot to me, especially since the Covid issue. Hoping this issue can easily resolved.
It is good app but sometimes unexpected errors are caused in between which make difficulty in studying.
Lags very much, disconnects all the time, if i have my camera onn in the participants it shows my camera is off
"I'm a student and I'm using this app from the past 4 months and it has given me a lot of trouble. When I'm in class suddenly it gets disconnected or my teacher won't be able to hear my audio. Even if my internet connection is perfect I always get problems like these. I won't be able to attend classes properly because of these problems, Sometimes if it gets disconnected and when i try to re login it just shows ""preparing meeting"" and thats it. Nothing else happens. Please solve these problems."
Unable to rotate to back camera while sharing camera. The option is disabled.
Keeps freezing almost on every important time, this app just freezes.
Very bad app It close it self and take lots of time to reconnect Ã°Å¸ËœÂ°Ã°Å¸Â¥Âµ and I do not want to give any star Ã¢Â­Â but I should give
Sometimes camera gets on while meeting, this is a serious issue, Sometimes the camera geta on or sometimes the mic on Wht is this!!!!!Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
Very bad quality! Connectivity issues and a lot of distortion.
Can't upload a profile pic. Every picture i choose i just get the same msg EDITTING IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS PICTURE like my whole gallery is not available for editting?
I don't know why but the app doesn't show the camera on in the participant list.. I have updated the app and even uninstalled it and then installed it again but the problem remains the same..kindly do something...My teachers consistently ask me to on the camera while it was actually on
Really, this app doesn't even deserve 0 stars. I left a review recommending it good, but what, it's really irritating all the time. Idk why, but it's terribly difficult to start any meeting. I lost my attendance today and what I'm more scared for is the exam, that's going to take place tomorrow. Idk why I'm facing a problem with the latest version. If possible, pls ignore this app, Google meet is much better.
There are many problems with this app. You can't set up a profile picture for your Android (phone or tablet ), the audio is sound like 10 ppl say the letters of the alphabet simultaneously, its worse if more than 5 ppl are on it, this makes it harder for me to learn anything at school , because of the problem I have to call each of my teachers for the work they give and to record the explanation
It keep getting off its feature of turning video on seeing chat or particepnats is bad ass during a paper if we try to write in chat box our video get off and we lose our marks. and its very annoying
When I want to start camera then stops responding and then It shows that failed to start camera.
Totally useless app. There are a lot of problems like voice issues and videos issues.
After updating zoom app I am not able to listen in the meeting. The voice is not at all clear .
It is doesn't work properly it was showing network is poor and not connecting
Android phone moto 3, keep getting error code 7 when connecting. Doesn't work.
I wanna give 0Ã¢Â­Â A lot of issues, sometimes, the network issue, or audio or video issue. All these problems are there despite my network connection is strong enough. And doesn't matter much either you update this app or not, it stays the same, and most of the times, it shows wrong meeting ID where I connect almost daily. Not at all satisfied with the service of this application. Adding on, majority of the times, 'server not found' or 'server busy' appears. Hope zoom resolves these problems soon.
I watch the wedding the sound was poor, the wind was noisy on the microphones, the camera was too far away from the bride and groom to see what's going on or to hear them. And there was a big delay and trying to get the zoom to work for this most important day of this young couples life. I would not recommend Zoom for anything. It was a gross disappointment. There was a one-time only to see this wedding for us who were 240 miles away and it was a complete failure on our part to see it and enjoy
"I don't get it why this app uses microphone while i am not even opening my mic. There is always a notification on my device ""Zoom is using your microphone"" even when my mic in the app is turned off. I feel like this is a serious thing, are they spying on us or what ??"
Terrible UI. Poor connections. Did I mention the UI is terrible? Like really terrible! I don't want it to auto rotate when I rotate my phone. There's no way to stop it! If I want it to rotate, I'll turn on rotation on my phone. Also, of I want to participate by listening only, I shouldn't have to give you permission to my microphone. Please let me listen without violating my privacy!
It's terrible everything glitches and when I click on audio it doesn't work
It is really a worst app Ã°Å¸ËœÂ . It is again and again showing error code when I go to join any meeting..... don't download this appÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
This app is good but the host everythings he can do.He close screen share,voice recorder.I do not do that.So little bit not ok.And it is so many data useage.For 1 hour for 1GB.
Latest Update is so Bad! I have been using Zoom since the start of the pandemic for weekly chats with family. It has not been easy, but we have managed to get the grandmas up to speed and to join without difficulty. This week, whatever update Zoom made to its platform was a nightmare for these two 83 yr. olds. One of them finally got things working, but the other one could not figure it out. She had to sit out our get-together this week. Very sad for someone who's isolating during the pandemic.
"""Describe your experience""wonderful, just amazing. How do I even describe the beauty of this app when I'm not even able to join the meeting I am seriously very frustrated right now. I've been trying to join classes since 1 week and I can't. It says unstable network tap to reconnect, Just tell me my all other apps are working fine, I can even browse easily then how come my network becomes unstable. I really don't want to abuse, because a lot of people can see my GOOD review. And yes, I'm done! F"
The app does not need mircophone audio to play sounds from the speaker. when you turn off incoming sounds from a meeting, it does not actually turn off the sound it just changes to the speaker used for phone calls, enabling the proximity sensor like you are on a call. Now you can't do anything because the screen would go black because the sensor was enabled
Last version deserved 4 stars but after the update, it deserves less than 1 star. I cannot give the spotlight to my video even when I am the host because my video icon is off (even when my video is turned on). This is a huge problem while teaching small children because we need to get their attention as much as possible and just a tiny spot in the gallery view isn't of much help. I can see that I am not the only one with this problem. ZOOM please fix this soon. Thank You.
Automatic crashes and exiting . Unable to attend online class properly , missed many classes.
As soon as I open my zoom app network connection gets zero and this not happening in YouTube or whatsapp there connection is good.please do something
Very bad app donot work on mobile network ..... Very bad app. It always shows REPORT PROBLEM .
If the virtual background and co - host is there in basic version so I can give all stars but that is not in basic version so I am giving only 1 star
It's a very bad and disgusting app... sometime we cannot join meeting as it is showing that network is poor and we can use other apps but not the zoom...it's quite clear that the network is not the problem!!!. Maximum time it causes such problems....!!!
It had so many connectivity problems. It didn't even let me to connect to the meeting because of which I missed few of my classes. I figured that it was all because of the recent updates that the links were not working and once I got the new update it not worked for my desktop. So I can't connect through my desktop.
Most of the time, it shows error code 5. It's really irritating. In previous versions of zoom, it doesn't shows that, but in the latest version it does. Sometimes it behaves like internet connection is poor. It doesn't loads. My internet is coming enough to load and work properly. I missed my very important meeting due to this issue.
Missed my weekly depression help group last week because zoom had changed EVERYTHING since previous week. No sound. I couldnt hear nothing. Nothing at all. Had to exit the meeting after 10-15 minutes because NONE of the methods I used the PREVIOUS week worked. Very frustrating.
Have a lot of problems with sign in or sign up and video goes off while meetings when i go to other apps.
I try it more than hundred time to sign up in Zoom but it says that you cannot sign up at this time........ Every Time I use this app I automatically gets kicked out from the meeting after 10 to 20 minutes then again when I try to get in that meeting again it takes almost 10 minutes to get in which is so horrible for me as a student because I miss a big important part of the teachers lecture please do something about it! also it always shows my device model name I cannot change my name
The audio is not connecting automatically
Not happy at all with the app. It worked well in the beginning but after few days it started disconnecting in between the meeting and if I tried rejoining it asks me to report the problem. I have reported n number of times but the issue isn't solved. Also I have uninstalled and installed it and updated as well thinking that would work but none of the tricks worked.
Never connect always shows connection problem ,always shows can't connect to our services very poor app
This would have been my first meeting except for the video and audio being off I was kicked out. It only took a few minutes to figure out how to enable it but it was to late I was removed. If the app asks for permission for the camera and microphone then they should automatically be on and you should have to manually turn them off. VERY DISAPPOINTED and now I have lost a days work plus another day when I have to reschedule.
It is a terrible app with bad reception. and a slightly confusing format for someone who is new to it
The baddest of all the apps. It takes so much internet that I can not tell. First I have used my mobile network but it shows connecting only. Then after I used Wi-Fi,still it is connecting. I am very disappointed with this app. The previous update was good. And after taking so much internet, when our Wi-Fi is not capable of giving more internet, again it starts connecting. I cannot attend my school and tuition classes. So I expect something more like using less internet from this app.
This is not good app. My daughter is always having problems with connection. There were couple of times when it said that the meeting(online class) had not started yet, even as we tried a lot of times to get in, when actually they were already in the middle of the class. And when my daughter is already in, it was either she is always disconnected or she can't see anything or hear her teacher. I hope that these issues will be dealt with.
Every thing is ok but If I use other apps in middle of the meeting It is showing your video is in off condition It should be in on condition
This app doesn't works as nice as in my brothers phone. It has many problems like in this app I am unable to sign in and it is very important for students to sign in so that they can put their dp in it. I also connects very slowly and sometimes it doesn't connect and due to this I missed my class many times. It is really a big problem for students .
I think It is the app for all platform..But I was wrong, It is only made for Windows Platform, When I Started searching all functions I founded that It has much functions on windows But not on Android..
Everything seems blur when network is little bit down.& There is no resolution filter..Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½
So I have an issue, I press the on camera and it's show my camera view. But in participants list show that my camera was off. I thought it's just bug in participant list , then my host ask me to on cam. From my device I already on cam, but in other participant it's show that I was off cam. This was a BIG issue , what's the point using app like this when you have this kind issue
I don't have a problem on network because it changes from place to place. But this time this new update have taken me to a problem. I have opened my camera but it is not showing in list. It deducted my marks during class hours( as i am a student).Ã°Å¸ËœË†Ã°Å¸ËœË†Ã°Å¸ËœË†Ã°Å¸ËœË† For not opening a camera . This app trubles me a lot . Secondly due to this app my phone battery got damaged .
This is the worst app to use to connect whit people Sometimes the app makes the mic so sensitice that other people hear you breathe from half a meter from the device Sometimes people barley hear you No off noise cancelling is the worst part
Audio issue, sometimes other person is not able to hear my voice.
This app doesn't allow you to run it as a phone app. You can receive incoming calls, but you can't click to dial, like you can Ring Central. That makes life kind of hard, when Zoom is your primary corporate phone system. Hard to use a phone app, if it's not recognized as an actual phone app on your phone. Terrible design.
Every time when I open this app it is always saying unfortunately ,not working, I have two or three important meeting in daily week on zoom and every time I missed my meetings ,I have already complaint so many times but every time they ignore my complaints , its my last warning to zoom otherwise unfortunately I, have to unintall this app it's the level you have crossed .Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ  Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ  this is the last chance , if you will again ignore my complaints then you now ............
New update is so much laging issue. Like it connecting.......... 5 minutes later about same Previous version is better
Zoom used to be amazing. I've used them since at least 2014. Back then, they had great customer service and a quality product. While the app works fine, the quality is greatly deminished when porn shows up during your professional meeting. In other words, their security is still not where it should be, and it takes months for them to respond to issues.
Always mute my microphone' is not working in the new update.please solve that problem quickly.
Ok I've had zoom for a while now and it keeps logging me out!, I don't understand why???, like I've done nothing and suddenly it logs me out of my account and when I go to sign in with Google I can't because it keeps saying the password or email is invalid, and when I go to click to send email I had to give my age and birth date, I'M NOT ELIGIBLE TO USE ZOOM AND ITS VERY DISGUSTING
This app is poop, this should get banned, my mic was once showing off but yet the voice was going and ........... I hate this, Ã°Å¸â€™Â©
After a recent update my front facing camera is no longer working on the app. It works on every other app on my phone, but goes dark like it's midnight with no lights on and no one can see me. I can see others in my meeting. They can see my outline but not my face or features. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the program repeatedly. Even did an update on my phone with no fix. PLEASE HELP!!!!
This app made a bad impact in our life. Pls include costly payment methods to host a meeting and timing of that meeting, this reduces a number of classes.
The new update is very bad after update in pc chat paste option is not working please do not update this app old feature is not working
Worst app is this i cant be able to joint properly video quality is bad and audio is also not working properly please fix it
This app is hot garbage I try to join a class but evertime it kicks me out there's nothing wrong with my computer and I have it downloaded on the newest version.
Since this last update, I can not get into any zoom meetings.
Virtual background. We really need this feature to work on Android. Currently its a below par experience on my android amazon fire tablet
As the app popped-up on the screen and automated,it had never been noticed that the audio upon reinstalling the app demonstrated on com. As it still doesn't work. Initially: The volume of the app only, was not allowing the conference to be communicated. Having navigated to enable in settings, ex. in-app volume. Also for tips online. It's the second time on a different device. Very sad
"Zoom cloud meeting app was good in"" April - may"" but after that problem started . No meeting is connecting now! If it's connected then automatically I am disconnecting and after that not connecting . All times it give "" check your internet connection, error code ..."" I have to take hotspot from another phone then it connects! now I don't like to use this aap . I reported the problem many times but nothing happens! It is useless app for me! Ã°Å¸â€˜Â¿Ã°Å¸â€™Â¢Ã°Å¸ËœÂ  Due to this I can not attend my school classes ."
"App rotates screen automatically even i have turned off ""autorotate"" in my device. its annoying"
I am not able to work on this app on Wi-Fi, it only works on mobile data from last 2 months. First I think there is some issue from my side but I checked my connection and reinstalled the app but it doesn't help. PLEASE LOOK INTO THE MATTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
This is one of the worst apps. I have used this app for online classes. There are many problems during online classes. The voice of the other participants does not come through clearly in the entire meeting. This app drains the battery very fast. It takes a lot of internet to work. If the network is good even then it does not work perfectly. If I want to open my front camera and unmute myself then I am unable to do these things. The functions in this app are good but the performance is worst
"This app is the worst because when I click the link in our group in messenger, it will open the zoom app then .....personal room then after a few seconds it will turn back to the website then when I click the ""Launch meeting"" button it will take a few clicks to work. HATE ITÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡"
Can not login. It eventually log me in but did not tell me what password it used!!! Useless! Seriously hopeless!!
Sometimes it doesn't work. I can't join meetings sometime it shows only connecting but doesn't connect and that's why I missed many class.
Worst app audio and video quality both are bad and sometimes it gets disconnected automatically
I don't want to give even 1 star because it is such a worst app. In 5 classes i am able to see only 1 r 2 alone. I is taking a lot of network. Sometimes the audio does not work r video does not work. I am in a village because of network problem i went to the town even after then it does not work properly. This is the worst app I've seen. I can split.Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¢
Sign in or sign up is very difficult. Voice is breaking. Sometimes, all are muted host is only in unmute. Sometimes, it is leaving the meeting. I did not like this zoom. I want to give 0 star for this zoom. I only download it for online classes. Please check out this
Very hard to use Zoom can't get any sound.
I gave one star to zoom cloud because there are many problem's . Firstly there are not the features which is on the p.c or laptop but mobile user don't use them so please get the setting which features are set for pc or laptop users , secondly the zoom cloud app automatically stop at 40 minutes so let's set that so we use unlimited. Thirdly the network problem , because when our internet slow down the zoom class was not active suddenly cut . Then i gve 5 star.
This app is a unnecessary app when i join a meeting there is no sign in button . When I go to zoom meeting to an app my video went off . I recommend don't use this app, its very bad app
1. Consumes more data than meet. 2. Please provide a way to save links to other meeting in the zoom app. Since zoom meeting id or link is permanent, so it would be good if we can save those links and directly open it through zoom. As of now I have to go to google classroom to search for that link, I want the link to be saved in zoom and so we can acess right on opening the app.
This latest version brings the big problem to me.... Auto call over internet not working
This app does not cater for old people who are set in their ways , make it easier so they can involve family members
Very bad app it shows that the video is off in participants list and when we go to chat box it closes our video please fix the problem
Its great until 2 people talk at the same time. Then the world explodes. The next 10 seconds consists of digital noise and sentence fragments, followed by a scream usually, then an obscenity. If you have the energy to fully moderate your call, complete with hand raising and muting, this could work. If you want to have a human conversation, maybe try something else, a phone perhaps. I hear that everyone has one
It is not so much Good app that I have thought. In starting for some days it starts good and it's picture quality is Also good but after some time it starts showing me report problem. I tried my best to resolve it but it yet shows me. I have tried to unistalled and then installed but it did not work. If you can solve this problem pls tell us.
This app is the dumbest app I ever saw
Very bad
Not good app don't download
Not intrused

No user friendly ,Audio are not clear.
Audio sound problem
It never works on my phone. Terrible. I've been left out of many meetings already because of it
Frustrated by it in lock down
I wanted to mute my mic while connecting so I enabled don't connect my audio but when I joined,my mic was unmuted and cuz of me people were getting disturbed
not much better app
Why was this app even made? Thanks to this, we have to do online school
It over laps pages on the verification site, wont navigate after that.
Their is incorrect password problem when i use right password. not very good app please try to solve thus problem
Its so annoying when I join audio my mic is unmuted, it's just so irritating that I have to mute myself everytime I join a meeting, the reason why it's annoying because the place where i attend meetings are noisy and it will disturb others. Maybe you could add a new feature where I'm muted when I connect my audio, while entering a meeting.
Not joining the meeting
Hectic app for students
Worst ra dei

Hello Zoom App Team, I'm Nitin. I using the Zoom App during this Pandemic. As a student, I take regular classes on this app, but when I going to connect to any meeting, then it shows the Error- 104103.

This app doesn't let me to sign up. When I try to sign up it simply says you are not eligible at the moment. I've tried several times but till now this won't let me to sign up.
Not at all satisfied with the app..it does not get signed in although having high internet..it shows network problem and error code comes on screen..its very frustrating when there is important meeting and can't connect..i just installed and in first meeting only i am not able to sign in..earlier it was working good..but now its worst..could have given 0 star if possible..Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ»

TERRIBLE TERRIBLE IT HORRIBLE
This app consumes a lot of battery. And because of this app I have to wake very early
Not user friendly. Always have problems with getting the sound to work/hearing.
Ok
This app not proper.
Soooo sad ...... .... ..... ..... ...... ...... ____, _____ ___________________ . ._ ------- ........ ..... ....... ...... ..... ..... ..... ...... ....... ...... ...... ..... ..., .... .... .... ..... ..... .... .... ...
I don't hear any audio. The interface shows no icon for setting wherein I could attempt to fix the problem. Meeting has already started so I ended up opening it on my desktop instead, where it's working well. Phone app is practically useless.
Zoom very bad app
Can't tell if my opt-out request has registered or not due to bad UI / UX. Every other button in the settings of this program is a slider that moves and changes colors, so you feel positive that you've chosen what you wanted. (Yes/No) (on/off) But! the opt-out part has no positive feedback feel to those buttons and there's no way to really know if you've actually chosen the option you want. Shady. The app works fine though, 5 stars for that part.
Pictures going black and not able to all people in meeting
The app doesnt let me sign in. It keeps redirecting me to another window to sign in however when i sign in there, it does not register that i have sign in in the app. Currently still has errors in the system.
No exprience now start
This app is waste don't download this app opening five minutes after it left it self and we want to re join
"i couldn't get in when i press ""Launch Meeting"". I got late for class because of this.."
More data consuming
Loses connection, distorts audio & no way to get live help. Most frustrating product I've ever used.
Volume doesn't work, even i put it on high, I cannot hear what people are talking...so frustrating..
40 minutes ke bad Baar Baar dobara join Karo... disgusting!!!
Super bad app that scammed millions
Z I hate it but I can call yeah but what I didn't unload it it's just that it's like I don't have enough space by cancel it that's because this is my mom's phone but my mom has a new phone but I can still not exit
When I make a meeting it says incorrect passcode
I have issue with sharing any file while attending a metting
I couldn't be seen or heard but I could see all d participants. And d audio kept fluctuating very badly!! It was an awful experience!!
I have trojan infection
When is the mobile app going to get available option to use backdrops... i love the app but it doesn't do anything for me without backdrop since i can't use it. Will continue with others .
This app spoil my quarantine days
Its very annoying
Deactivetion not shown anywhere
Horrible, I can't get the sound right
Very bad i cant conect to the meetings
"I heard about the privacy issues with this app but am almost forced to zoom because I guess it's the ""in""-thing to do. I'm not convenienced this is as convenient or secured as we think it is."
Can't install it dont know why
School sucks

While i am in metting i came bace the video is off it can continue like that mean i am very happy
bad
Good but not so good as teacher mutes participants and participants are not able to talk to teacher
Worst app...I never seen in my life
Perfect app for online learning
Bad quality
I do not like that because it is not update
At first it was an excellent app. I was able to do my tutions properly. But for a few days I can not join any class. It results in improper classes on tution. Please fix this problem. I have excellent connection then also it does not show passcode box. It shows only preparing meeting. I don't know others have this problem or not. But please try to fix this problem. I would be very glad
Kind of a bootleg Skype in my opinion. If I only use my phone for this, I constantly have to swipe the screen for transferring between people on screen. I can only see 4 people per screen, so I'm constantly having to flip back and forth to actually look at who is speaking if the meeting has more than 4. Kinda dumb really. I feel like the old woman with tooth lipstick, blue hair, and pearls pointing at the screen from the old music videos.
When ever I am present in a meeting it kicks me off immediately and after a few seconds it will come back into the connection screen yet to no avail thinking it will not do it again but I was wrong it does it around every minute or so. Also it is a battery drainer every time I am on the app. Honestly I wouldn't recommend anyone to use this app until all of the bugs and glitches are fixed.
It is good with many features maturing with time However it does keep exiting, crashing, incompatible when using bluetooth speaker, repeated rebooting This happens to me on different smartphones and not one So the software needs to become more for a smooth or stable experience. . Not even that this happens because of large no of people participating. . Even 10 people I have these above experiences
We always have to write a meeting Id and password and sometimes the password does not work. And on mobile if i sign in , zoom then changes my name and I have to rename everytime. And if I am removed by the host, zoom then tells that you were removed once and you cannot join again. Even the 2 stars I gave are not worth it.
The desktop version works well but the mobile is very weird. I use it to watch classes from college and sometimes I have to watch it over the phone which is a nightmare! These are the problems I experienced: - Not allowed to use bluetooth headphones with no mics - no control over audio if the host is showing a video(which is normally very low) - The audio of the video which the host is showing gets cut if you go to the chat or if you minimize the app
Hi all I wanted to share my experience with zoom with you all.... It's a good app....but the only thing is that a lot of problems occur while a meeting is hosted or I host a meeting...for instance I was not able to unmute, not able to leave, Keeps on turning off my video...so on I hope that it functions properly on the future without any discrepancy.... Thank you Have a nice day :)
The worst thing in it is a lot of network issue. Even if the net connection is strong then too the meeting gets disconnected. You need to update your system so that we have less connectivity issue
You cant even change the stream video quality. Say if I want to conserve my internet data, I cannot change or lower the quality of video for that. The quality of video is fixed by the app itself. Other streaming platforms like youtube offer this changing quality feature so I don't understand what is the problemtoaddit.
Never auto connects to audio. Once you join a breakout room you MUST leave the whole meeting to get out. Pinning, can only pin in specific sections, why not just right click and pin? Overall, a lackluster of a program with too many drawbacks that too many things have adopted
It's like a fun app! just for it I can do my classes. i can study properly,even tho teachers don't know how to take the exam.Zoom is normally good for me.i don't know how to explain this.sometimes zoom disturbs me for network problem.Thats why I didn't like it much.but I can chat privately with my friends! that's good
Awful app. I've just tried to schedule a meeting three times. When I try to invite an attendee, it drops all the meeting settings and creates an 'anytime' meeting for an hour.
Zoom is the best app for doing meeting but I am giving this app only 2 stars . Zoom, I suggest you to improve your app because when I go to see the the participants list my video is automatically turned off. I am very embarrassed with this feature. And another thing that embarrassed Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¤Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¤Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥ me a lot is with the strong internet connection also I was disconnected Please improve your app.Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥
The app is useful. But there are many errors occurring with the app. Like error :- 104103 or error :-5003. The app users aren't any software engineer or something. My meetings are canceled due to this problem. Whether the problem is with my device or any other andettes device. Again, the app is useful but the errors need to solved
The major problem I faced is that I can't delete messages which are sent in chat box. Sometimes by mistake we student send messages that should be sent or can be sent more appropriately. Also we have to keep on switching from public to private message settings in the same chat box area which sometimes creates a big problem and embarrassment when private messages are gone public. Please fix this major issue.
I was forced to use this for online classes but both the audio and video quality is bad and it's just so unstable, the only reason I am giving this a 2 star cause u don't need to create an account to join a meeting, this apps only plus point.Google now is a much better option
I'm a teacher and Zoom was a spectacular app for the windows version. But recently, I just switched to taking classes in my Android tablet and I couldn't find a lot of features that were there in the windows version. My humble request is to add all the features to the Android version and then it'll be absolutely flawless.
I have a small request regarding zoom. Can the software programmer update the zoom app and add a small feature by programming in such a way that when we appear exam using google form, the video gets auyomatically off. It must be added that the video cannot be turned off automatically. It will help us to be involved in the exams properlyWaiting for the positive response from the programmer!
It's always have some major bugs like 1.having problems in signing in ; 2. after signing in , it automatically signs me out . 3.when changing profile picture , it doesn't work ,then i have to change it three times and after some times it changes again. 4.Also with video quality , it is always blur. 5. Audio is also not clear..
Need to improve!! In solving bugs. Though I am attending classes with 3Gb full net it is reconnecting. There are some problems in this application. I was forced for this app for classes. Add similar options for both laptop and mobile(tablet) users. My tab heated and one-one time not working bczz of this app. Always showing Zoom isn't responding. I found this problem only in the app.
1st, i noticed that their virtual background seemed off-tangent or a bit weird 2nd, i do not know how to upgrade from basic to professional level (there's no clickable direction or instruction on how to upgrade to the next tier) lastly, i find it not so user-friendly especially in share screen overall, i gave a 2 star because there's still plenty of room for improvement...
This is good but there are so many problems: 1. It overheats my phone. 2. It takes a lot of time to send my sound to my friends. 3. Please try to fix virtual background for phone. 4. Original Sound is useless. 5. Please try to make zoom more stable in low storage phone.
This app is nice for my online classes. I had logined in my Facebook account and using the zoom app. But now it is not logining in my facebook account. It is sayingÃ¢â‚¬Å“facebook is not availableÃ¢â‚¬ÂÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ . Please fix this disability. Or else you may lose many users of the zoom app....
I have trouble everytime I try using it for my elderly father to do his doctor appointment's. Better try logging in 2 hours before an appointment. Doctors office said 10 minutes, nope...
I don't like paying for the letting to be longer then 40 minutes! It's crazy that I have to spend money to see the friends I can't see because of COVID. So it's sucks I have to pay
After the last update my camera gets switched off when I'm at participants,chat box or anywhere else from the main screen...it's creating a lot of problems in my exams and in lecture also....
I don't like Zoom. Sound quality isn't great and even when I haven't muted my microphone or speaker beforehand, it occasionally decides to do it anyway. I'm sure Messenger would be far better.
It's ok. Not much better. Its is consuming more data. And the main problem is when allowed to ask video preview before joining the meeting it is not displaying. Its the one thing which is really problematic for me.
Zoom has been very useful for our academic meetings during coronavirus shut down in the country. It's one of the best apps available for meetings.. Edit: Alright zoom, enough is enough. Everything was just working fine for almost a year but dunno what happened, now for the entire past week zoom is crashing on and shutting off my device automatically. Pls fix this is! My phone shuts off all by itself and restarts only when I am using zoom for a meeting! And my device is a Huawei.
When I schedule a recurring meeting, the Start Time defaults to Now, no matter what the intended starting time is. The only way to show your intended Start Time on your invite, is to have no recurrence. That is not right.
Nice app . But nowadays I am disappointed with it . When I open a second app keeping zoom running in background it turns off my video . Please Understand My Problem . I REQUEST THE DEVELOPERS TO PLEASE FIX IT . IF THIS PROBLEM DIDN'T EXIST I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STAR RATING
1. If i write the password right its showing incorrect 2. If i log in my zoom its asking password it always its incorrect 3. if i go to participants list and come back my video is not working properly
I gave it 2 star because when you pay for the subscription it seems like you're wasting your money and even after you paid the privilege you get is not matching up with the price and there is a lot of issue with the app.
"You know what , now I hate this app. 1) Nowadays I suddenly get out of my meetings when i don't even touch that ""leave button"" and not even anyone moves me out. 2) My internet or wifi is too much good, that all apps work nicely but not zoom. 3) high connection then too that type of problem?"
Tablet works extremely poorly, extremely crackly sound, almost can't understand it on the other end, video slows to a crawl.
The app isn't working on my phone. I try to uninstall and reinstall it, and it doesn't work. I can't connect.
Very limited features compared with the desktop version (like the cam effects, camera quality, gallery view.. you can only see 4 people in the gallery view even though you're using a very big tablet such as samsung tab s7+). And the zoom camera is not flattering at all despite having a good front camera.
I am using zoom from past 9 months for my online classes ... previously if v move out from the screen the video freezes and v return back it work fine but in this latest update the video is turned off automatically when v leave the screen...v students face many problems because of this....
I'm not able to hear what my meeting host is explaining, it's very uneasy to tackle this. And yes during the meeting if there's a call my audio is audible to me and again after a second or two it's wossh!
All is good but I don't like one thing. And that is that we can't on the video and open other apps. If we do that our videos are getting off. It'd be better if they stuck like that. I'm talking about app in mobile phone, idk about website.
Worst update ...it take lot of time while connecting it take 1-4 minute to connected the meeting..
I would have given this app a 5 star but I have given it 2 stars because 1. It does not work properly 2. There are many connectivity issues and 3. Video quality is not good. Hope that you will understand and try to improve this app.
Earlier it was a good app but nowadays it's starting making issues of net but in other apps my net works perfectly and the net tower is not that far . My sister attend the classes on my phone . Sometimes when she has to sign in (it's like impossible) .
Video quality is good but there is too much static where you can't understand the ones talking and video dragging and stalling. I can see only four people at a time..where is the gallery view?
Not as expected, even after updating to latest version, It's not able to connect meetings and when it connects the voice starts to break and screen shares goes blur and sometimes screen get blanked even when there's no network issue , it's so irritating and disappointing as well
When I click the link .. zoom is open but'when it's show conectivity it back on the link .. & say some problem and whatever error occured something like 100410 .. & also check your network connection even than my device is connet with internet.. I will join meeting almost 15 minutes late ..
This app is going worse to worse day by day. When we turn on the video then if we go in participants list then it shows that my video is off but it is on . After coming from participants list then also it shows that the video is off . We have turn on the video manually . Fix this issue. Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ 
I am unable to use screen share in my phone since past few weeks!! It is very difficult for me to work without screen share. I have already re-installed the app twice!! Nothing seems to be working..
"I use this and it works well but when i tried to sign in through another device, it said *""You are not eligible to sign in to zoom at this time""* . Pls fix. And it is very bad app."
The audio is bad cause it makes it have a earraping version of someone talking which hurts a lot and sometimes my mic wouldn't work after using my headphones, even if my mic was open they couldn't hear me at all, I need to delete and download the app again to fix it but it doesn't work anymore-
I was having a good experience with zoom but as soon as I changed my phone it isn't working properly. I am not able to share screen.. no matter how many times I click on share option it shows nothing. Kindly Help!!
Just beacuase of audio cease, I give two starts. It doesn't support recorded audio in the background. It supports live audio but doesn't the recorded screen sharing with audio. Please fiz it and I would give you 5 stars..
Very bad app doesn't work on occasion, in other words it requires lot of memory space on mobile for it to operate. Lags a lot. Better would be that it mentions the issue and doesn't keeps user in limbo by mentioning that it is connecting.
This app is all over very nice and easy to use but sometimes there is so much problem like sometimes the teacher cannot hear our voice if we plug headphones to it the version in which there was an option of selecting the mode like headphones or speaker it was much better than this version You should work on it
I have a problem it we go to participants our video is being offed and if we go to any option it's offing. After connecting to meeting after some time it's coming blank I can't see anything and I need to join again once. .It is just disconnected during
Best app for doing meetings. Problem: When I go to participants it automatically turns off my video .This is so much embarassing and bad.please improve ur feature and 2nd problem: it sometimes when my meeting is disconnect and then it comes error 10413 error 5003 error 5 please improve zoom
Zoom app was good before the new updates.After updating there are problems with my video.Whenever I turn on the video ,it is switched off in the participants list.No one can see me in the meeting. So I am having problems with my online classes as well as online exams.I have installed it several times.But the problem still exists.Kindly fix this issue as soon as possible.
Very worst app though I have on the video in the participants sections it is showing of. Why is this problem occuring. This is a very big problems to students because they will be victim in their classes. The zoom team is not responding through gmail.
I was give two star because in zoom meeting whenever i use chatbox there I need delete option because whenever I write wrong sentence than i have chance to delete that sentence. That it's why I was give you two star .
I love this app but for some reason sometimes am not able to login to a meeting even when i have the right ID and password, i have to try so many times and eventually i login.
This is a very great app. But it always show that zoom meeting is not responding when go to start my camera. (In pc). You should fix this problem.
We get disconnected automatically and its very annoying
It doesn't use Bluetooth speakers as audio devices, if you connect Bluetooth before opening the zoom app, itu not working very annoying
Have been trying to get the best results from this app but I have to say it doesn't work properly. I get connect, I can see everyone but I can't hear them nor speak to them. So I have to leave the meetings. I'm using a sansugn S-8 just in case. Can you help me please with this issue. Thank you.
As a student, I do not find this helpful at all. Sometimes it just logs out of the meeting and sometimes I can't even join. You can't update your profile picture either which I find really annoying
Zoom app is the best video conferencing app. But after updating a zoom new version there are some problems. They are :- 1. Spotlight video problem for the host . 2. Camera showing off in a participant list .
The app is fine but recently I was facing a issue, ; i was unable to hear the audio but audio of my phone was prorper, resulting i just got messed and was unable to attend 6-7 meetings.
As soon as I join a meeting the mic starts which is not appropriate . whenever any student joins a meeting through the app as his mic is on there is so much noise in the meetings
Good app... But when I connect to my Bluetooth headphones to call over internet, the video becomes buffer and strucks only when I connect to my Bluetooth headphones... Please help me for the problem
The app is sometimes useless because after 20minutes we are automatically leaving the meeting Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜ therefore it's weird ..... the video call is also sometimes not clear Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡ pls be involve in this review !!!
This app is nice but when my network is working properly it says that poor network connection. I am like what cause my network is working properly and does not connect I am really disappointedÃ°Å¸ËœÅ¾Ã°Å¸ËœÅ¾ and I am really angry with this problem please sove it cause l miss my classes and get scolded by my teachers so please solve it. It really cause so much problem. Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­
"ITS GOOD APP . But the problem is i get Diconnected again and again from the meeting . And sometimes when i want to on my video its shows that ""Make sure ur camera is not using any where else"" but my camera is not using any other app .....Just fix these plz"
This app has a lot of bugs
The latest version of zoom is disgusting ,while seeing the list of participants my camera goes off .
After the recent update, problem with network. Keeps closing and do not connect automatically. Recently can not even connect and join the meeting.
Should I say about once upon zoom or present zoom Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡ see the difference how much i have been seen in this.. before i thought it was good but after a few updates it became Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡such waste.now i can't understand to laugh or cry about this Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡plz bring back the original zoom without any updates..
I don't like this app because often It is regoing I cannot lesson my class but one thing when over I can talk with my family numbers that's good that's why I gave 2 stars for you some times video is not getting on
Hey zoom team, Zoom sucks a lot of data even for 1 meeting ... Which is highly disappointing....
Improve the glitches as my free meeting was of 40 minutes but it ran for more than the time being. The meeting only ended when the host ended the meeting. Kindly see to it.
Ok, now your security features are doing okay, but, 1. There must be NO 40 MINUTES CAP on meetings. At least, increase it to 4 hours. 2. A DEFAULT VIRTUAL BACKGROUND must be enabled. It is not available right now on my smartphone.
we use this app for our church meetings, as well as for family gatherings. I have never had a problem until the other day when it would not recognize any of the passwords it kept saying incorrect even thought it was correct. Has any one else had this problem?
It's good first time and while using it has an issue that it shows video is turned off in participant list . Problem must be fixed as possible. Thank you.
It mutes a lot of voices sometime I'd talk with my girlfriend from there and if i give her a kiss she won't be able to hear it, it gets mute or something that she doesn't hear it
The video off/on feature is not working properly. Even if it is turned on, others can't see my face. Such a huge inconvenience during meetings
Required remainder option,i received meaning scheduled and id, passcode but am forgot the meeting, and difficult to keep meeting id details, So provide remainder option with pre loading meeting id and password.
This software is good for meeting in this quarantine but it needs so much mbps if it doesn't get then it loads and loads and in the recent update if we use another app while using zoom, our camera turns off please remove this feature
Nice app for students and people but still a lot of bugs are there. If the bugs and removed then I could say that the app is useful and outstanding.
Now Ã Â¤Â¤Ã Â¥â€¹ I started using let see how it's work then I will comment Few months past i am using this app it's nice app yes but in mobile I can't find background change I loved this app yes but when we type the right passcode they says incorrect passcode So I have to join from the link
It's really a amazing app it works best.But it is not working some times and coming as report problem. It doesn't work that time. And it comes error it takes net much
Virtual background option doesn't show up on all mobile devices, unsure why.
Now it is facing to much problem I never thought it would happen live it and when my video is on it is showing off
Before when we go back on other window or go to participants then our video was use to pause but now when we go then on any of them our video is being off? Resolve this problem! I am still facing it
The actual app isn't bad, but it doesn't let me sign in through Google. Gives me a really anoying 300 error every time.
The main problem is that it disconnect and then automatically connect whenever I was using it and this process continues for a long time.
I'm unable to change to virtual backgrounds on this android.
WHEN U TURN ON YOUR VIDEO AND GO TO THE PARTICIPANTS TAB , IT SHOWS THAT YOUR VIDEO IS TURNED OFF.!! SO I HAVE TO UNMUTE YOURSELF.
It's pretty surprising that Zoom doesn't support Google Chromecast. Also equally surprising the app doesn't support picture in picture on android or desktop. and thats very bad
Can you please allow audio recording because when I screen record it doesn't record audio which is been hard for me . It says the app doesn't allow to record audio.
It's nice but after recent update it's not working properly. Like auto connect audio isn't working we've to connect to audio manually.
While using this app I had a problem that my video is showing off in the participants list even if it is on.
When i was updating this app my meeting got cut off . I had a lot of problem in rejoining it .In the time of meeting always cracked voice is coming
The latest update is the worst, when we go out of zoom camera off. Its very bad
This application is having a serious problem... I had switched on camera but also my video is not viewed on other's device... Fix it asap.
When we are on a meeting it automatically disconnected and when it connects the voice will not come pls fix it And when we connect to a meeting it is connecting late when the network is proper
3rd class app .. I am a student and i used this app manier times first it was going smoothly but now i constantly go out of meeting without any reason and when someone takes me in I am unable to go in .. Thats so irritating
NOT user friendly. Voices would fade in and out. Could not hear nor understand people. Would not recommend Zoom
If turned on our camera it's showing that it's turned off and whenever we got to participants list it automatically get off these should be improved for free android users
Pretty embarrassing Android version with only 4 participants per screen whilst Apple and Laptop users have many multiple users on screen. Leaving Android tablet users to have to swipe back & forth. Very poor.
Bad experience, im having trouble with connecting voice the meeting and it keeps unable to connect. Wouldve give higher rating if it werent for the voice problem
Overall this app is very good for online meetings and classes , but there is a problem it consumes so much data so, its a request reduce its data consumption
This app is nice I have online classes and this app helps a lot l...,it has a option raise hand...,chat we can talk with our teachers but internet connection problem...,
Your app has a bug, if the host gets disconnected without closing the meeting for everyone, the meeting gets extended when the host joins
It has been cutting me out of the app once or twice, it's getting worse, and its a new appÃ°Å¸Â¤Â·Ã°Å¸ÂÂ¾Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â„¢â‚¬Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€. Fix it or it will remain 1 star. Where is the yes button for the third question Ã°Å¸Â¤Â·Ã°Å¸ÂÂ¾Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â„¢â‚¬Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ°Å¸Â¤Â¦Ã°Å¸ÂÂ¾Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â„¢â‚¬Ã¯Â¸Â?
Its very bad because after update, it crashed, froze, and restarted my phone in the middle of a hearing.
Because it is only of 40 minutes in basic version in other apps it is providing unlimited. other thing we cannot share audio with mobile when we share screen.
There are so many things that to improve in zoom. Charge and net balance both comes ta end in a little bit of time.
This app is not connecting after the new update. connect audio is not working. Its very disappointed
My profile picture is not clear in meeting. And the video quality is not so clear
Poor service .......in the new update whenever i switch on my video ,it shows in the participants section that it is off.....you know teachers ask us to switch on our video.....got scoldings many times due to the same reason....please help zoom...thanks
It is not connecting properly because of that many lecture are not attended. It always have network error, we dosen't have network issue. its very disgusting
Giving two stars as the video itself get disconnected and connected . It creates trouble while the only classes and sometimes teacher marked absent just because of this reason and its annoying
Hi! Team Zoom App is not working . I will try to sign up but failed . They show you don't sign up at this time. Please solve the issue as soon as possible
Sometimes if i want to join in a meeting it is showing invalid password or id even though it is correct.
Previously it was fine when I join using zoom app, but right now I was not able to join as it kept preparing meeting forever.
Please add a documents section in the chats section to send documents. Helpful for students and teachers to understand their mistakes while teachers check copies on camera
Ive been getting black screens at random times when my finger or object is over camera for no reason. FIX THIS ERROR before I get rid of it!
I want this app to be updated and in this update, you should put the thing that when someone messaging someone during the meeting, the message gets deleted.
Camera is super blurry, mic works really badly, its hard for people to read my chats
Great app the best !! But I put low rating becouse on the pc version. You cannot raise hand as a host or cohost wich would be Soo useful !!!!
When i update the zoom it does not show any new features, it's good and easy to use but please make sure that it should have new features and i can't post my photo in zoom....
It gets rotated automatically if I held the mobilealong with the landscape line. Fix this as soon as possible
While I was recording screen, I couldn't record sound of host. Its very annoying
"I couldn't sign up or sign in There was ""You are not eligible to sign up or sign in at this time"" Fix it out"
We have to sign up or sign we do this so only virtual background and virtual effects come
It is a very helpful app but Dp is not changing in this new update.please take a serious action on it to resolve the problem.
Good but difficult to start meeting again and again. Many times faced the problem of starting up the meeting
This app is good for online classes but.. host should not have a permission to disable chat so that we can chat with our friends.. Please fix that problem and i will give 5 stars..
After apdate when video on that time my mobile show video off. And when my video off that's time show video off.
The desktop gallery only show 4 people. That would be a lot of exercise for my thumb to scrolling everytime I want to see the others.
Please ...I always kept my camera on but it is not showing to host that the camera is on...
Zoom is good but the recent updates has been destroying it. Our teacher is never able to start the class only black is coming on the screen. 8n emergency or network issue when i join with any phone then it shows my video is off (participants list) even if it isn't. Also why am I getting disconnected everyday in the same class. Its the most annoying thing ever. Because of the updates zoom has been getting worse and worse. Please fix it. Please Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â
I am having an issue with microphone. I am trying to turn it on but its not working. I still I am facing this issue
Pretty counter intuitive...seems your developers never understood how to make the audio intuitive and easy to use.
At first it was working well and tgen it just suddenly stopped working and kept telling me that i have to connect to WiFi or data an even though I was connected it still didnt work. I reported the problem three times and it was still not dealt with.
It is nice for video and audio quality but not upto the lvl ,it oftens come out and shows me error code
In this app for mobile or in tablet we are not able to add the profile picture easily in settings so please make sure that we can add profile picture easily in mobile and tablet also
Its functional over all But the usability is low, the ui is quite bad and very laggy. The screen sharing have a lot of trouble the video is normal but the screenshare tend to be laggy ican barely se any thing
It has network issue the voice of the speaker is lagging behind and it always reconnect. Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â
Earlier it was good, but now there is problem in the app. There has been an option call over internet since the last few updates. This option is very bad. Sometimes we have bad network and then the voice goes. In fact, a few minutes into the class everything becomes inaudible. The earlier option by using device audio was much better. I am a student and I miss what is going on in the class when the audio goes away. Please fix this and I am sure I will once again give this app 5 stars. Thank you.
It change is setting automatically from using mobile network to wifi so this is the my many of the meeting has been gone so I just request to do something about this problem
It is not a good app I think. It is often leaving the meeting. Even while joining the meeting it is taking a long time to join. I have these issues even I have a good network. I have given the report for many times but it had no response.I don't like ur latest update. If we go to participant list our video is off. I don't like this update. U may remove this update in the next update.
I have been using the app regularly since June, 2020, but suddenly the app has stopped working since last week of August, 2020 both with the help of wi-fi and mobile data. Other apps are working really good except zoom and it's not even working in my laptop too. I have uninstalled the app twice, update the app regularly, reported the problem in the app but nothing worked. I would request the developers of the app to please help me out of the situation.
Product support is terrible. Even with paid subscription, it takes 4-8 weeks per response on a ticket. Unless you need service from the company. In one case I asked a question on Sep 2 and got a response on Oct 30. The support response I received, after a LONG wait, was generic and didn't apply to my situation/ problem at all.
So yeah, I've facing this problem for 1 month or 2. First it worked good both in mobile and in laptop/computer but now, mobile is facing problem. However, there are 2 problems. 1. It lags so much when my network is excellent and it lags the other apps too. 2. When I switch tabs on my mobile during a meeting, the camera automatically gets switched off and I've been facing this problem from a month or 2. Please fix these problems and I can have a peaceful meeting.
Should be easy, but getting audio is difficult, seems there is another screen one has to press
Zoom virtual background option is not present in Android mobile that's why I kept 2 stars for zoom
At first my experience with this app was decent. I had no issues joining my classes and everything was going smoothly. And plz make a lite version for PC.
There's no way to record meetings locally, on the device. The app offers only cloud recording. Which is a paid feature.
I didnt really like the app. Every time that I want to start a meeting it says that I have to log in
Picture quality is good but get disconnected during meeting try to solve it. I
After the update in September everything is having problems. The voice is breaking, the videos are not appearing, the meeting gets disconnected itself and gets restarted itself , the meeting shows connecting for more than 15 minutes then it gets disconnected. If this problem is not fixed soon I'll having great loss in my workplace.
Zoom I am giving you only to stars beacase of my network is good but it is back to meeting and I am tell to zoom to improve your voice and I am telling that to improve your zoom app
Now a days there is a issue coming in zoom that the meeting left between the class. So it takes a lot of time to rejoin the meeting. A new update came but I am not able to put the virtual background in the meeting.
In most ways it looks like an upgraded google hangouts, but less intuitive. It is constantly nsgging me to reconnect to the meeting that ended and i disconnected from a couple days ago, and i do not have another meeting for a few days.
Application closes and restarts automatically. Get irritated.
Zoom app is good. One of the best apps. But even though i switched on my video, it is showing that i switched offed my video. And its reconnecting every time, even though i have a good internet connection. And the app is updating itself, without the users permission or not knowing to the users. Please make sure that this problem is not repeated again and again
Not much good Google meet is much better because it has a lot of network issue and software problem which is still not resolved by zoom authorities..............
I have a problem that when I connect meeting after a few days the first meeting is disconnected.
When will Zoom add android system audio to shared screen? Webex Meeting already has added this much needed feature on android platform???
I am unable to connect. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, checked by turning the airplane mode on and off as instructed by my who said it worked for them and even rebooted my phone. Nothing worked. I cant attending my classes and this makes it very difficult for me.
I was facing problems to connect in classes because it was showing connection issue in my account but some time it is not working properly again showing that connection issues for that reason I am going to give 2star but some days ago I have given 1star because it was not resolving
This recent update has really screwed with my phone's audio and video. My normal camera works fine, but when I enter a meeting, it looks like I'm a black silhouette in a super dark room. And I used to be able to listen to a video and the call in the same audio source, but now, it's one or the other, I don't know if it's because of the android 11 update.
I just dont get it.when i start a meeting i cannt see the other person but i can hear them. Then it keeps getting out of the meeting. So i miss part of the meeting. I just cannt see no body. since day one that i download the app i havent had a good meeting. This is the only app i'm having this issue with. Cause with Due and other apps work fine. Why am i having this issue.
Not the best ever it's so laggy and there is problems in the mics and cams when I use it in my classes it doesn't work good that's it ;-;
"I was trying to sign up for Zoom but keeps saying ""sign up failed"". I changed my birth year even but nothing."
Upgraded my account and then couldn't get into the account, costing me a very important deal. Beyond frustrated as when I called support, no one was available to help. On calling sales, they put me to the support voicemail line and basically said they can't help and tell me when I could expect a call back. Frustrated and disappointed is an understatement!
Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â best for my online classes ,but I just recommend one thing that it must be possible that we may zoom the screen I face the problem while looking at my teachers board So please team make my problem be solved Yours faithfully user Anand
Initially the experience was good, but since past two days it is not working properly. The camera being on shows that its off in the participants section and to every participant. The video of a person keeps getting on and off by itself, though that person has kept it on only. That's a huge bug. Please fix it.
It is not connecting through my phone. I dont no what is the problem. It is not working. I have sent many time reports in zoom app itself. But no respond.
This is a good app but after asking password it shows that there is an error or server down.Also sometimes the voice cracks . How much you update it it will work as it was before. However strong your network be it does not easily allow us to enter the meeting . Due to these problems , I have missed many of my important meetings and was left confused . Hope, my problems will get solved.......
When I want to turn my video on and I turn it on someone says they can't see me and in participants option i see that my camera is off but my camera is on ,why can't they see me?But noo now do something say why can't they see me ,I am sure its problem in zoom
"Zoom doesn't handle logging in with multiple Google accounts well. I can't join meetings with either account. The app seems to also launch a web browser for login and does not transmit the fact that you have the Zoom app on your phone since the website says, ""If you have Zoom installed..."" I mean, yes, I do have it installed because that's how I got here...! Sloppy programming."
Zoom is getting better, still not great for phones. When using the front facing camera the video is super dark. Don't give me lighting tips, light is good, it works in every other app just not zoom. I have to have a bright light inches from my face for the zoom app to pick up any light at all. If I switch to rear camera, no problem. It's just zoom and just the front camera. Also my resolution is 16:9 but I can only broadcast in 4:3? I wish BlueJeans was the industry standard. SMH.
Connection not smooth for longer periods gets disconnect and reconnect, disturbs my meeting.
Works okay, but privacy is a hoax. Zoom is always watching.
Technically proficient video conferencing app, but poor user interface. I keep seeing people struggling with muting/unmuting. This would be less of a problem if there was an option to always have mute button visible. After tapping screen to show button, it disappears before it can be pressed if the use is a bit slow. Not yet optimised for wider audience. Better than the Windows version that has unnecessary use of too many windows that don't observe sensible rules for multi monitor location.
Worst app. But it has to improvise more on video and audio recordings.
I thought I'd give it a try as recommended by a work colleague. Not an easy experience.. very awkward to use, unlike what's app. The need to send a link to person to communicate was the one that annoyed me. Also highly pixelated when video streaming and breaking up, unlike what's app which I never get this problem, very strange! Not easy when someone is in quarantine and want a basic chat. Better for large meetings yes, it's not what I wanted. Moving on from this back to what's app or messenger
I ve always been joining zoom meetings scheduled by others, Am to scheduled a zoom meeting myself since yesterday but couldn't because the icon to schedule a meeting wasn't coming up but only to join a meeting that's showing on my page. I do I have the icon to start a zoom meetings from my fone infinx S5. Thanks
I recently faced problems on zoom which were not before...Even though i keep my video on during the meeting , in the participants list it alwady shows off. Due to this , fix it as soon as possible . Looking forward to your reply.
"I planned a woman conference & the day before during rehearsal the break out portion did NOT work. This was essential to meet my needs. Used chat several times for HELP because calling was not available. You do not chat with a live person. I know because I asked could they retype a word & I was given, ""I am new,"" for an answer. I was told only Sales answer calls customer service calls. CS was for business customer only. Awful Ã°Å¸Â¥Âº"
In this app when you join audio in a meeting the button keeps freezing and dont get join please Fix it!!!
My camera shows the whole object longer and taller than the real object i dont know what the problem is i tried uninstalling and reinstalling the program but still it is not happening , fix the bug, that is the whole reason why i gave the app a 2 star rating . This app is truly very bad it has nothing , when i enter a meeting i can never see the shared screen, i dk what is happening to this app , guyz i am telling you dont download this app
Most times I can't get the microphone to work using my cellphone. It's very frustrating.
Very bad always always disconnect show error something I cannot listen and even in the meeting
I am a student. Sometimes if I try to connect to the meeting, at the first attempt I successfully joined the meeting but suddenly after 1 minute it automatically went back to the 'Join Meeting' page and showed Connecting but after that it showed an error! Please fix this problem. I know that you are working very hard and it is sure that this problem occurs everyday because there are crores of meeting held in zoom and network toooo. So please fix the problem
Dear developer, previous version was working properly but as I updated this app few days back it started creating problem. I keep my video on but it shows icon of 'video off', my students are unable to see me and my screen. Sometimes I am visible to them but most of the time they cant see my video. And in this situation my screen is visible to me but not to others. Please fix it asap.
I was in my class on my School iPad then It was starting to lag and I can't see the screen then it kicked me out of the meeting 2 times very annoying that's why I give 2 stars
Not just bugs.....but lots of lag too when i slide the screen for seeing others screen.
I had a job interview and downloaded the app; the video pixelated, sound hiccupped, and the connection was awful. I apologized for my connection and asked if I could try to reset. I did so, and while that was going, I used SpeedTest to confirm my connection was humming with 108+ Mbps Up, 38+ Mpbs Down. Reconnected, same issue. I asked for one more chance to avoid a reschedule and they allowed it. I uninstalled the app and loaded through my browser: fixed. TL;DR - App is trash, use browser.
I always say that zoom is a good app. But now a days I have to leave the zoom meeting again and again while the meeting is ongoing. I am happy with the previous active behaviour of Zoom. I think this time also Zoom will give a satisfactory service taking my problem as urgent. Thank you.
Attended a meeting last night where the host opened all participants' videos & audios for the whole duration. I could NOT see where my video & audio were & also have no option of turning them off! It's ok if the host controls who can speak but please give us the option to remain private while we're listening. Such a breach of privacy and its disgusting!!!
The meeting was automatically ending within 40 minutes, and sometimes we are facing some issues like - eventhough I turned on my video, in the participants list it's showing the video was off. Facility to change profile picture also has been disabled .So this is little bit complicated and also it's getting signed out automatically.
I am forcibly giving Zoom 2 star as I am facing a huge problem. In Zoom [Version: 5.3.2 (53291.1011)] its problematic to record. It has no manual recording option. When I go to record any meeting, whether by a screen recording app (Xrecorder) or phone manual screen recorder, it shows that us.zoom.videomeeting: conf is currently recording audio, so I cannt record the screen with sound.
I was able to be seen, but no audio. I installed and reinstalled 3 times now. I gave all applicable permissions. My siblings have had a weekly zoom meeting which I have not been able to participate in yet. 2 stars were for video. 0 stars for audio. My siblings are angry that I am unable to join th err m . So am I.
"I like this app and have many features for video conferencing but the issue is that when I try to upload a new profile photo, it shows - ""Unable to upload the profile photo"". But in some cases it works but for other images it don't. I don't know if the issue is related to resolution of the image or whatever but please fix this issue."
Is there any option to option to record the meeting with audio and video ???? If not, so, please make it available. Besides these , it occurs some problem like video quality is too bad and please try to solve these problems but is a good cloud meeting app but why i am not eligible for making a room ?? I am 13 years old and i have my own tution classes so why i am not eligible to be a host ??? Please find some way.
Nowadays, I always found many troubles, I. E. , When I join the meeting , after some few minutes , it often notify that , ' reconnecting please wait.. ' . even though my internet connection is good with the other apps.with this reasons, I can't join the meeting with full pleasure .I hope , the said issues will fix as soon as possible.
I just signed up and it's telling my email or password are incorrerect while I sit here looking at my password and email as I type it
But now recently it had stated to crash again and again. This is a very annoying issue I'm facing. There's one more issue that in participants' list it often shows my camera off even though my camera is on.
When I do meeting in zoom, sometimes I mistakenly press the camera button, and the camera gets started without my permission, so I request you to ask us before letting on the camera or voice. Also sometimes suddenly the voice and video of the host and participatants gets struck and then I automatically get out of the app and then it keeps connecting.
Why always my camera turned on, on screen but not in participants this thing disturb me a lot please fix the problem.
There is no raise hand icon when iPad user is the co-host. Please work on that.
Really poor! Sometimes the screening doesn't come and lots of glitches. Kindly improve. There is room for improvement, would be great if this works perfectly, especially because I have to attend lots of online classes per day.
It was the month of june i have placed my phone 20 meters away from myself and my microphone was working but now i had to go closer to my phone to speak. I think this is a bug and sometimes when I click on more, the emoji will sometimes disappear
When I am on my video than in gallery it is showing but in participants list it is showing off. Why did it happen? Look at this problem
The last two updates have made camera so bad. When I use my camera normally it's fine, but when its in a zoom meeting, it's so bad. It just darkens everything and no one can see my face. The experience has been so bad. Please work on it.
Video option not working. It's not visible to others.
This app is good but I think after this update the app doesn't work perfectly. Because whenever i start or enter any meeting i don't get notified in status bar. And whenever i open another app over it it closes the meeting.
It's disgusting to see that virtual background option is not available for Android devices even though Androids have far superior front camera but still virtual background option is not available on my device.
My video screen changed on my android the other day. Now my video looks like a funny mirror you see in a circus. AND ITS FULL SCREEN! This probably wouldn't be so bad, except I have meetings every week and I cannot figure out how to fix the problem, or, why my screen changed in the first place.
There are some major problems in app are:- 1. When we are connected through video option then the voice of host starting to fluctuate and we are not able to listen.. 2. When we go in participant list it shows us video option is closed.
My phone strat heating as soon as my lecture starts. This will damage my device. Please work on it. Charging also decrease very fastly. I'm very disappointed. Please solve my problems.
It's bad that zoom will stop automatically again and again , sometimes the all screen goes black the video will stop after some time this app has minor but very much problems I'm not satisfied with this app. I ask the developer's team if they can solve these problems it would be better I ask them to please solve these problems so that we can use it in better way.
Whenever I try to use any recent apps my screen goes black which is really not good. It should just show my photo hanged......
I am a high school teacher. So greate to have this app. Every time developer try to fix issues, but they unfortunatly creating the new bugs. This time the update brings mic and speaker issues with it. That is why i gave 2 stars for my experience. So bad bad.
The app is good but it doesn't retriev the mobile data properly .It should suck max data speed but should give a good video quality ... Other app such as @youtube works efficiently in the same data speed .. when we switch to any other app the speed of data increases bt while using zoom automatically the speed goes down like a hell . So I think @zoom should be improved and suck little more data and increase the speed of retrieved mobile data .as @ play store does all the time .
Not bad sometimes the audio was breaking. Except this all features are nice........
Okk app but not too okay because they are many problems such as when I am in .eating class it disconecteting and when we enter the password its show wrong and when fav subject paper was was coming then its not work so very bad ..so please fix
Another lack of security features in the Zoom video conferencing app is that the meetings aren't encrypted end-to-end. As per reports, the security features on the app are similar to using web over HTTPS. This means that even if the connection is secure, the video calls can be decrypted by a third party.
It's intenshions are good.But not available to all considering that I am on a tablet.Not a phone.Not a computer.And it's just not giving me all the options that I have on my computer (school computer).
I really didn't like the feature of turning off of camera whenever we are opening chat or participation section. Whenever my teacher opens to see the chat for any query the camera gets off and I am not able to copy the notes from the board.
Not a good app. The security isn't strong at all, hence it isn't that strenuous to hack into meetings. There has been an instance of me being hacked. Once, somebody hacked into my online class and changed my name to a slur and the teachers didn't let me in afterwards due to my intolerant name. My camera always seems to turn off whenever I go out of the app. Was this made intentionally in order for your teachers to get you caught, or is it a bug? This app needs to be improvized more
I think zoom is a great app but I think it needs more update like students who mistakely open camera without knowing. There should be a feature saying that do you really want to open camera I think this feature can protect students privacy and private life. I hope that zoom official can see this and bring the feature to zoomÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ËœÅ  Please do it because it is very necessary for studentsÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ËœÅ 
With my new Poco X3 it started being buggy. Sometimes it just crashes the phone, and the phone displays some squiggly lines, emits a loud sound and reboots.
It showing connecting only. Because of this I miss my lectures.
ZOOM Windows client is great. The side by side view feature is wonderful. Unfortunately the same feature is not available on Android or iOS so we are not able to use it with users that do not have a computer. Please implement this feature.
I am giving it one star only Coz it is irritating me .. After last update I have observed that if I open participants of zoom or opening any other app my vdo gets automatically stopped coz of that I have been scolded many times(as I'm a student and going on exams too) ... After new update also my problem not solved...
"This app is good only i have been using this past 5 months... I have updated this app recently...there is a bell button in chat box if we press that it says ""you will not see any chat notifications in the meeting"" after pressing MUTE also the messages will come and my video is on only but it is not displayed in participants. So please fix the bug"
I am sometimes unable to rejoin the meeting once disconnected. This app has probably some fault. I cannot connect to the meeting quickly and i often have to reboot my phone. Sometimes it just don't connect me to my meeting.
It was nice app when I started using it. But after some months it automatically disconnects me from meeting when there is no network issue. And that dumb lastest update show my video off in participants list but it is on in gallery view.
If we access some other app when meeting is going on then our video automatically gets off and also when we receives a call at that time and also when we go in participants it gets off before it was not like that . Before last 2 updates if we go back then our video gets frozen and that was the better feature, also it gets disconnected many times.
Its ok but i can't host my class...the passcode gets changed every time when i start a meeting...and it also takes more time to join some meeting...worst...time getting wasted...please improve your application..i can't handle with bugs anymore!!!!
It's a great app but after the update, the app's functions are wrong. Connecting slowly even though when I use another device that hasn't updated, it works. There are many problems please check it or do as you promise and fix it please.
This is not a good app, but when I downloaded at first it was a great app but after update it gets disconnected every 5 to 10 minutes from meeting (online class) and says can't connect to our service and my WiFi Is strong please fix this issue, hope zoom.us will consider and fix this soon.
Its an useful app but some features are not of use and the feature enable orignal sound was useless in zoom.
I m a student and I using this app from last 6months.it has given me a lot of trouble. When I am in class suddenly it's gets disconnected. My internet connection is perfect. I won't able to attend my class properly when I try to login it's show preparing meetingmeeting and nothing happens. Please solve this problem
Great app but can't get the sound to work very frustrating.
The app closes automatically when my mobile goes to sleep or when locked (Even on PC and Mac)
In this version of zoom.we cannot show the video to the other in maximum phones.so try to fix that problem by update or your team will loose bunch of zoom users.please fix it as soon as possible.only two stars will given this time by me.Ã¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­Â
Lately I have an issue with the video. I already turned it on but it seems that my camera wasn't working. My colleagues can't see my video. When I check myself in the participants, the camera icon was off even though I already turned it on. I've tried many time to solve the problem but nothing seems to work.
It was good earlier works smoothly, but After the latest update i am facing audio issues i am unable to hear the voice of participants who speak (i don't have any internet connectivity problem). After every update app is becoming worse fix this issue immediately my classes are going on and due to audio issue i am unable to understand the lesson
I have missed two consecutive meetings. Can't connect to your service. It is frustrating, it used to work perfectly now I don't understand why I can't connect.. My network is working fine.. Don't want you to tell me my network has something to do with it. Please kindly look into this and rectify the issue.
"Today I tried going on my class zoom call like always and was met with a ""To join please register"" so of course I registered and updated the app. Now Its not letting me join my classes at all. Whenever I try joining again it tells me ""Finish Registration"". When I click on the button it just takes me to the home of zoom and that's it no steps no nothing just blank. its very annoying"
I have some technical issues that when I go to participates it turn my camara off or when I chat then it also turn my camara off automatically. Its irritation.
I need to share my screen , and unfortunately in this state, I cannot see chat messages in the notification bar. This is the main reason I prefer to teach with another app...
I updated the app today and I noticed that when I use the front camera of my phone (Google Pixel 2) It's so dark like the iso or shutter speed was adjusted on the camera. This also happening to my friends who have the same phone (Pixel 2 and Pixel 1) Its very annoying
(Best Android device content and mobile screen sharing quality -Co-annotate over shared content -Real-time whiteboard collaboration on Android tablets) U have kept this sentence in discription board but I'm not getting screen share at all as if I'm host also
This is a nice app for my online classes but sometime when I'm joining my classes so much error is occurred, like the voice not comes cleary nd also someone can not hear me clearly sometimes my video get stopped automatically. I get irritated by these errors .Please update the functions...
It's good but many times it shows that the meeting password is incorrect Pls solve the problem fast
Virtual background not available in Samsung galaxy Tab A7. My galaxy tab supports live focus phot however, zoom does not give me option to set a virtual background. Not available in my galaxy tab a7
I'm a student. This app is a worst app I have never see.a 40 minutes later it will disconnect and when we join it takes a long time for joining.more bugs.you can check clearly.
I can't upload my dp. Every pic I choose was not supported editing. This app is a mess.
The consistency of the recording of the app has dropped significantly the last 15 days. Prior to that I would have rated it a 5 star, but it had really gotten poor. I hope they fix the stability and reliability.
Very poor network. When I write correct meeting password but it says that it is wrong. My network is very good but during class, when the class is going on, it says that poor connection. Do not download it.
When I go to the participants page or chat box my video automatically turns off. It wasn't happening before. All of my colleagues are facing this. Why is it happening I couldn't understand. Please look into the matter. And overall progress is satisfactory. It's easy to study in this app. Thanks.........
Both in Desktop and Mobile, this is a bad software/app. No tutorial in-screen of the application. What if older gentlemen and ladies who are not literate in technology use this? They would get confused. Do not use it like they project in television.
It needs high speed .. Due to Not every places have that much speed i faced problems
From the starting I downloaded the zoom app. It doesn't show any of the problems. But, when I tried to login in the zoom app it is not getting log in and it is showing invalid email and password. In the old version and new version both it is showing. Plz fix the problem ASAP.
I have no idea why everyone wants to use this. Constant network problems, unintuitive quality of life features, and overall pretty painfully slow to connect to meetings.
Hi , Its is a great video app we can share screen upto 100 members. And our children also listen to the online classes i did not like this because As it does not connect when I am using this if I connect this to bluetooth speaker the sound is not coming that is the main problem so thats the reason I am giving 2 star Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸ so I hope they fix this problem if they fix this problem I will gave 5 Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸ Ã¢Â­Â
It have some related problems too.....always I get disconnected in the meeting continuously after 2 or 3 minutes......and also the time limit is very less it should be unlimited.....please fix these problems if it's possible........
I gave them 2 star because after doing latest update I found, on my side camera is on but participant used to said that your camera is showing off.Also This app is not able to grab more internet speed .Most of the time my zoom app is not working but when I switch to you tube or any other app My internet speed goes good which show internet speed is good but zoom is unable to take internet speed.I want that you will sort out this types of bugs soon
It is very slow on pc . It USUALLY showing (Zoom Cloud Meeting not responding) It would be so thankful to think that this would not happen after an update but is not . More likely it is taking more time to start and respond , and nothing could work Ã°Å¸ËœÅ¾Ã°Å¸ËœÅ¾ Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ¼Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ¼
It's been a long time I am using zoom but after having the latest update a new problem in zoom has arised.My camera is directly turning off while switching the tabs or even it I go to the participants window or the chat box. I request zoom to kindly fix the problem because being a school student it's very difficult to handle such video issues....thanks
"I have to uninstall, then reinstall, this soul sucking app every time I join a meeting to avoid the ""preparing meeting"" blank screen. I suspect this is because there are issues connecting to multiple enterprise clients across different hosted servers."
I've used Zoom in all its different formats, PC, ios and android. Both mobile apps have some limited functionality which I understand but I wish the android app had at least the same functionality as the ios app. It's very frustrating. Please, please, please let us see more than 4 people on the screen.
Please enhance the quality of the app in many ways so that it interesting and interactive.
Problem is I don't know why... it's not connecting class..with full network.. this situation is happening with me from the past few days according to which I am not able to take my school online classes..
didnt work nicely had problems with the verification email always redirected to wromg Profile
I usually have very good experiences, however this time the meeting kept kicking me out. The sound kept coming in and out as well so I didn't catch everything being said. Great over all idea and product, but it needs some sort of fine tuning.
I use the whiteboard frequently to write note. It is very effective in laptop. But whiteboard performance is not up to the mark in TAB version. When I move to new whiteboard, some writing of previous whiteboard still exist. While writing with stylus(S pen) whiteboard sense my hand also. This create irritating straight line.
The old version of zoom was really very good but now I have a problem, when I on my video, it shows an video off icon along with my name in participants list. This problem is a big problem for me as in my school , to on our video is compulsory. Kindly fix this problem Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â
It has become quite better since the last time and working smoothly but can you please look at the app size. The app occupies large space in my device due to which it shows CONNECTIVITY ISSUES DUE TO STORAGE. Even though I don't have any extra apps.
I am a regular user of the app owing to the fact that all my classes are held here. Recently with the newest update, things have started going wrong. Even when my camera or video is on, the people on the other side cannot see me and my video is shown to be switched off on their end. Also, when my camera is switched on, my video icon on the participant list visible to me is shown as being switched off. I have got into a lot of trouble at school because of this malfunction. Please look into this.
Its not coming to login. And the audio is unavailable and the video is struck struck.
It is an good app ,but when i try to join my classes it never joins the class and i have to join several times , because of i can't join my half class , and i miss all my classes . It just irritates me a lot .....
I think you have very bad quality of video and audio Google meet is better than you google meet have superb quality of video and audio I think you have to improve yourself
Video quality is poor. Mobile charge gets down quickly. If the charge is 97 it comes down to 21 after using for only 3 hours and my video is showing off even if it is on. I have updated it but to no avail. Please do something. It will interrupt my classes.
Unable to figure out how to pull up gallery view on my phone in a court setting and was irritating the judge because I couldn't get all the participants up on one screen. My phone is a Samsung galaxy S9.
I discovered I find it difficult to hear participants when sharing my screen and participants say my voice is breaking and freezing I reset my Samsung A6 tablet to factory settings twice but the problem persisted I think zoom has a general audio hitch that needs to be fixed immediately in order
After its update in September..it is not good...there is no good video quality, voice breaks, and our video offs when we go back to home screen..
This app is annoying. Because when I start my cams, it show off in participants. And because off this many times my proffesers removed me from the meeting. I reinstall it but the problem was same. I changed the phone but the same problem occur. Many of my friends faced the same problem. Please fix this problem
Useless app. A nuisance and a ideat application. After the update it became useless. It takes time to connect. And reconnects at every moment.
After the latest updates. The app is crashing on my redmi note 9 pro max. And there is a bug that on meeting section it is showing my video and audio is on but in participants section it is showing that your video and audio is off. Please fix this problem as fast as you can.
Two stars because whenever I open the app it kicks me out. Secondly, I have to join a lot of times and the connectivity problem. And lastly,it has low volume problem and the video stuck up after a few mins after joining.so plz fix these problems asap.TIA
What's wrong with this app when i switch on my video it doesn't make sure that, in the same time in participants list it shows video is off.
The updated version is not good as because while using it in android and doing this earlier video used to pause and now the video gets stopped and that's why the host feels he or she is not interested if a phone call comes during meeting the video gets stopped and the reasons are mentioned why I disliked the new version earlier was very good....
Now it just freezes when I have the sound on or something. Why fix something that wasn't broke?
So this bugs a lot Like for ex. When I open my camera pn a zoom meeting, some ppl sees that I dont open my camera My friends have experienced this too Well I dont think I'll have enough space to put everything here I gave this a three since overall its a pretty great app. Ight this is an edit Im changing it to two since there was more bugs and I hate it I hope the bugs get fixed.
Sometimes it shows connecting but not connecting at all. I am not able to use it from my device because the audio is very bad, can't understand anything. But if it works meetings are not so bad
It keeps disconnecting for 20 to 30 seconds and then connecting again. It's very annoying.
"The zoom app for phone won't connect to the audio for some reason, and whenever I tried to join audio, there would be words saying ""Call over internet"". Tried to download it from Chrome and didn't work either somehow."
Limited to 45 min. Sharing documents is a problem. Video quality is okay. No possibility to use multiple screen. I am using it only because I have to. But I will remove it as soon as possible.
Even my video is ON (one can see me), but in Participant's List it always shows off and that is creating problem moreover it is difficult for me entering in the meeting in first attempt and I have to try to rejoin again and again.
This app causes a lot of problems..... It causes a lot of problems.... cant hear my teachers and so i miss important notes.... i wish i could give 0 star but i gave u 2 because it provides good service sometimes.. Also while signing in i had a lot of issues... and its very annoying
Not as good as the PC version. Moreover there is no pin option where I can pin my teachers video and not get jumped into someone else video. Also it would be better if I could mute a participant for myself. So I don't have to ask the host again and again to myte everyone.
Phone in participants are unable to join meeting even when using password. Told they cannot use! No explanation and no help!! Have sent a total of 3 tickets without a response or resolution! Why?? What is the solution? Fix it and you get another star!
But I don't know what happened now, the problem is that I on my camera but it shows that the camera is off. Due to this I've been scolded from my teacher.
Its a 50/50 chance if it will connect or just buffer. When it does connect, its amazing the quality of sound and video.
Camera new patch is not good. Cause i got to chat with my friend in other app . So when im switching my app, The camera turn off Automaticly. Idk if this a bug before that this app freeze my vid
Sometime it suddenly stopped I always use this zoom in computer but it doesn't open and they says unable to join , network issue but my network is proper. Even I tried in web but it stops in few seconds .
Previously when i was using this app in android while checking participant list or minimizing the app in background the video was getting stuck but now after update the video gets off. This is troubling me a lot. So plzz i am requeting to fix this issue as soon as posible.
Android app works good on Note 8. Android app is being dropped on Chrome OS. Chrome Extension has not worked well since April on Samsung Chromebook plus. I guess I am not to use Zoom on Chromebook? I love Zoom, please listen and then fix.
This is a very good app but when you get connected in any meeting ,but it is a very bad app when you are having connection issue not network problem and the report problem section is the worst because it is useless it does not helps you except irritating.
It was a good app but after new update whenever we on video and go back on home screen our video automatically offs..please tell how to solve this problem..because of this I m having problem in my examinationÃ°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ ...pls solve this problem as soon as possible......Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¦Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¦
Keep getting disconnected. And delays in video and audio
I love the app it is just that it works perfectly fine when there is less people and when there is 20 or 15 it makes me so glichy. Now the virtual background it doesn't work for me and I turned it on but still there was nothing that says virtual background please fix this problem!!!!Ã°Å¸ËœÂ and it will be 5 stars for sure
everything is fine but when we attend any meeting , we used to surf aother apps allow in between the meeting and at that time video used to be stucked but after this update instead of video stucking camera off s automatically Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜i hate this , plz bring back that video stucking feature .
I am not satisfied with this app, i face so many problems during my online classes,but it helps me in chatting .the main issue is that i get constant error code no.5 but when you reinstall this app you may not face this issue
"I never wanted to rate apps until today with this ""amazing"" experience I had with zoom. Zoom was actually a fine app until this experience came along that it keeps appearing incorrect meeting passcode even though is correct and I have tried it like tons of times. Thank to that I missed half of the class"
It's doesn't launch meeting many times.. It simply say's click the dialog shown by your browser.. But there is no dialog available thera... Or it say's to click launch meeting.. When I try to click it doesn't open anything... It really feel bad.. It makes me angry many times.. Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¤
Zoom in nice but updating it this time creating some problems in camera.When we go in participant option or chat option the video will get off and it is irritating.So I kindly request you that please change the settings of the zoom and make it like before.And also it is creating problem in screen sharing . When I didn't share screen it will show stop share and when I will share it shows start share so please work on it also and try solve this problem quickly as much as possible within 4to5 days
I rarely get connected to the meeeting. Almost everytime it shows 'an error occured'. I've reported the matter several times, but still it gets disconnected even after getting into the meeting.
Unable to disable waiting room option. As it is very inconvenient to admit each participant in the meeting.
Now a days zoom is not too good because when I go to the participant list it shows my video is off but my video was on then also.Ã°Å¸â„¢â€ž I don't know what happen to the zoom app it's not too good like first, it's lil bit OK! Never install this app. When I put my new profile pic on zoom, the zoom app is not showing the new profile pic it's showing the old pic. After 15-20 minutes It's showing my new pic. Although zoom is taking so much of time and data to put the profile pic! Not to install it.Ã°Å¸ËœÂ 
I really enjoyed the app, but now I see that after I signed in I can't change or edit my profile picture.
Video quality and sound doesn't always work... Poor... Its very disgusting
The zoom app for desktop is the very standard for cloud meeting apps. Unfortunately the smartphone versions are lacking. There are phones with 6gb+ ram and enough processing power for releasing a nuke, so is it that necessary to tone down the features.
Not a good app for school students. Many times the meeting did not get connected and the video quality is also very poor. When there is no network issue than also such problems occurs.
I'm a student using this app for online school in I would rate at 4 but have given only 2 stars because of screen share option I'm not able to screen share with sound in mobile phone and it's very irritating and also about the screen it gets freezers in between the class and becomes a major problem . Also with audio and video suddenly video becomes black and white and freezes and audio doesn't get Unmuted at all and v have to get shouting from teacher and are marked absent please look into this
It's ok bare bones video conferencing but costs a fortune, only streams poor quality low bit rate and is very sensitive to poor signal quality. Also RIDICULOUSLY expensive if you want to go over 40 minutes.
Many times voice get stuck.And missing the most important information by teacher..Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€œÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€œÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€œÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€œ. Its very annoying
It is not good enough for the students to attend the classes from this app, all of through the video is pausing and showing as error code and my network is good enough. The students are gonna miss there classes sometimes if this issue continues.
Very helpful and impressive meeting setup but I had to give it 2 because Im useing it in android phone and it doesn't have the options which is in the laptop,desktop or something like virtual background even I can only 4 people at a time that's really annoying My computer has some problem so I can't use it Plz I'm requesting to you for those options that are in the computerÃ°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â If you give that options in android phone so I will give it 5 starsÃ°Å¸ËœÆ’Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­
I have seen many time that my meeting is not connected I don't know why from my side the the ranges is full but may be due to server problem computer say to report a problem and sometime the host is speaking but voice is not audible
Initially when I installed this app I used the share option but now for last one month even after updating share button is not working and I am unable to share screen,use whiteboard or share anything from gallery.This is making the process of teaching very problemsome. Even when my video is on it shows that my video is off in the list of participants
Im irritated with this latest version. Its insane! Whenever someone else talks,my system starts lagging for more than two minutes! Please fix this as soon as possible!
The app is totally fine but the massive Promblem is that whenever the link is shared in the chat box the time i click on it it takes me back to the meeting and sudenely the link also dissapppears Or even if the link gets open then the meeting gets end automatically . Pls fix this Promblem if this is fixed I will surely give it five star Thnku.
I used it twice and I have issues with the audio.. I couldn't hear anything..I don't know how I suppose to fix it because I can't see any settings for microphone or something..can you advise me please what I should to for the next time !? Is it something I must choose like setting!?
"Why on earth is it so difficult to create a link to a meeting?? It's completely unintuitive. Surely someone in product management must recognise the value of a button saying ""get a link to a new meeting""?"
I am also using zoom app sinse last 8 month but in the begging every thing was perfect but after two - three months there was a problem the voice was not clear and cracking. And ya but in mobile we can not add our photo that is my problem and everything is best in it
It's sometimes showing some wrong when my video I keep on but, it shows in patispates that my video will off
I'm trying to join a meeting with the code provided, but it keeps sending an error message. The quality of the calls are average, the connection stability holds up well. The ease of access for the user however is quite poor.
"Its a good App but when using it on my Android Smartphone I cannot see ""All"" the participants in 1 Window just like when you are using Zoom on your Desktop/Laptop Computers. I really hope they can make it happen on Android Smartphones too."
This app is not so good because this app has many problems one of that is when the host shows a picture the screen gets blurry it is so FRUSTRATINGÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡and some times the the app gets stuck nothing works after that then it shows zoom is not responding this should be fixed till that time i will rate this only 2 stars
This app is a great boon for the students to keep up their classes during this covid pandemic. It worked well a week ago but now video connecting problem is occuring repeatedly. No response from devlopers of this app to my request about connecting problem. So bad and horrible..Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€œ
If I sign in and attend the meeting in iPad within 1 hour I am not able to open the app itself and my school wants me to update the profile and it is only possible if I sign..what the hell is happening. Many iPad users are also coming up with the same complaint
There is a lag while displaying self-video, however the audio not plays properly. So there is a mismatch between the audio and video.
The quality of video is absolutely horrible and sometimes the audio terrible. The app glitches alot
My sister's iPhone cast audio and video thru TV but for some reason android app isn't optimized to do this. Please fix.
I am doing class in this zoom. But i am facing problem when i join class in phone. There i can't see multiple sharing screen also i don't get any file when i use mobile phone.. it's really sucks system. I request developer please add feature in mobile phone to see multiple sharing screen.
At first it was good but now I am unable to join the meeting the app is stuck at connecting page and takes 5 to 10 minutes to join. Even the internet connection is good. Please fix this.
The video is turned off when I look in the participants and now zoom is getting slower and annoying
Overall good while starting ..... But gives a lots of problems after one month usage it disconnects , video not visible and even sometimes not audible..... Because of which my half of the class is left... So , I hope you will help.... Thanks....
Video and audio quality is very poor. It has disappointed me. Whenever I join the meeting it only shows connecting and connecting and nothing else. Please resolve my issues Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â.
Speaker sound is too loud and cannot be lowered and its horrible
It was really nice app. But after some days it had some problem.my video was unmuted, but in participants list it shows video was off . It was only one problem in this app. Please tell me the solution.
I gave 2 stars bcoz is this new version when we open any other application even when we go into participants list our video automatically gets off .this creates huge problem especially while giving online exam
I am very disappointed with the app .......It worked good at starting and now it always shows an unknown error code occured and couldn't host or join any meeting even the network is very fast .....Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥Not a good app..
This appÃ°Å¸â€˜â€°Ã°Å¸â€œÂ± was good but I always they ask to me update this app ans and I update it sometimes there was Ã°Å¸â€ â€¢version but my class was not join and they tell it's reconnect and ask to me tell the problem to zoom honour every timeÃ¢Å’Å¡ no there was problem and from few days it's working well in this problem my half class is gonna so make sureÃ°Å¸â€˜Â from now this prblm can't face me
Nowadays it's not working like before .our videos are on but in participants list it's showing off.teachers are shouting at us bcoz in participants list our videos is showing off but our videos are on.
honestly saying this app was pretty good but one feature we loved the most was clicking to homescreen and our image was stuck and cam was also showing on but now even if we go to participants list its showing vid off we cant use insta whatsapp like before ....think about students also dont make it strict classmroom..
I was just previously updated the app and next day when I was joined the meeting I was able to hear others but my voice was not reach to other people....... This problem is not ignorable........ It has better video quality but please try to improve video and audio quality too .... Ã°Å¸â„¢â€žÃ°Å¸ËœÅ 
"Google Pixels get the dark camera issue and our phones with the ""best camera"" are the ones seeming to be blamed, only in zoom it works dark... I don't want this to be happening to me..."
The old update of the zoom was nice but new update is worst.When we are going to chats, gallery view and participants the shared sound is not audible. It should be improved.Their is a request. Please improve this problems.
It is kind of good.But everytime I have classes,the first class eats up like 500 megabytes,so I am on a kuota budget here pal,you can't expect me to use 500 megabytes for a 38 minute zoom meeting,hope you can fix this issue.My 22 gigabytes was wasted in 14 days because of this app
Disconnect every time... And new issues now a days ...video on but when we go on participants list there were shown VIDEO OFF ... it's very uncomfortable.. I request to the owner of this app please remove this bug from the ZOOM app...Ã°Å¸â„¢Â
When i have update the app i am suffering from network isue . .i have network issue when i use this app .but when i use another apps their was not any problem of network . i am facing network isue only on this app.....
Now not working good before the lastest update but now when I get in the participation list it shows that my video is off before the last update it was showing on but the video was paused.So plz return back that feature and there are some bugs also related to mic
I am not able to add virtual background. I have updated the app but still not able to add virtual background.
It is a very good app for studies but still it takes a lot of charging while doing a class it even needs a lot of network if I am doing the class and goes to the chat box switches off the camera please fix this. Thank you
I updated and in the middle of the meeting it just gets disconnected without any reason for more than 10times in an hour. Then it shows preparing meeting and then says there is connection problem.
It was gud before the update but after updating this app..my video is getting off automatically when I go to the chat section Nd when I go out of this app, so I'm rating it only 2 stars..so pls fix this problem as soon as possible..
As per everyone comment, now the camera quality is grainy and it even shuts off the camera. Very Disappointed and cannot reccomend the app in its present state.
There is a latency problem in bluetooth sound.. it is too screechy and it is not upto the mark.. without the app, the bluetooth is fine, but when the app is open and then when we hear a song, it is too bad. Pls fix it
Constant wifi disconnections
It has given me lot of trouble during online sessions and even though I've good internet connection still it shows that u have a network problem and I've reported the problem so many times but nothing seems to happen like then what's the use of complaining.
You dont solved my problem ,my problem was of pausing the video while using another app of typing in chat.
After recent update, it is unable to join meeting if we enter meetings ID with manual typing and it shows invalid meeting ID but if we Copy and Paste it, then it get able to join the meeting with same ID. Resolve the bug.
This app is nice but what's the only problem I found in this is I can unmute and speak but after sometime if I unmute my mic to speak my voice is not audible to everyone. I request you to sort out this problems.
The app is pretty good I would have given 5 stars but after the last update I am a little unhappy as when you go to see participants list your video/camera goes off and also first when we use to start using others apps like YouTube etc the video use to get pause but now it directly goes off so I am not happy with that give us an to pause our video while in a meeting and at the same time using different apps and I would like have two or video pin option at the same time Over all the app is good
I like this application before but in the new update it became Ã¢â‚¬Å“THEÃ¢â‚¬Â waste application in cloud meetings it is like when we are going to participants list our video is automatically turned off and when we lower the hand also it is showing lowered on main screen but when we are seeing in participants list it is still showing that our hand is still raised and if we also on video it is showing offed in partisipents list and soo, many glitches and bugs please solve these all thing in the next update
I have network issue while using zoom I can't able to join any meetings it's still keeping connecting
I have a problem with this first it was working properly but now it is not working properly in mobile phones thats why I am rating just 2 stars when problem is solved I will rate 5 stars work on the problem.
I thought i can see all my classmates when i go for online class for the first time but nooo i can only see 4 people at a time which is very annoying plus the app is not very user friendly nor is better then other apps. It a shame my teacher prefer using zoomÃ°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­deer developer if you guys add function to allow us to see everyone on mobile then i change my rating
This app is good but it has so much of network problems, voice problems. Etc And it takes so much of network than the video quality and I automatically get updated......thank you
Even though my zoom app is updated the app is not connecting. Whenever i try to login it shows that we couldn't connect to your services.
It's a very good app for classes during the pandemic COVID -19. But it is doing some problems in the video option my exams will start a few weeks later that time I would have to turn on my video but I cant because when I turn it on it shows that it is on to me but my teachers keep on saying me that my video is of and for the exam I have to turn it on so please fix it.Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â
It was well. But after some updates the conditions are worst, when I switch on my video and switch to different app it gets turned off. The same thing happens in the chatbox too. Please fix this problem, students who are doing classes are facing much problem. Kindly bring the update as soon as possible
Before updating the app it wasn't having any issues but now when I on my camera in the participants window its showing off and also the speaker quality is very low , I request the developers to please look into this problem.
Too loud. Phone volume is the lowest it'll go. Can't find any volume settings within the app. Glitchy audio misses a syllable every other word. Interface not intuitive.
I wish we could see everyone at once even if it's very small on my screen / also, sometimes it dosen't get me through and I miss the whole meeting
It's a very good app but have the problem is fixed
This app is very bad because my network is full but they say that surver is low I have to sign up but they do not connect my surver . Half hour gone to connect surver but not connect . Very bad . Do not downlod this app . Really disappointedÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ 
It was running good so far, however since last 2 days, probably after an update, the camera is turned off permanently and I cannot switch it on....
I'm trying to use the annotate feature in Zoom and I'm using a Chromebook. I had a student who was able to annotate and she said she was using a Chromebook so now I'm trying to figure out how to set it up for myself. When I go to the Play Store, my only option is to Open it when an update was released on the 28th of October. Why won't it update to latest version on Chromebook? I'm still on version 5.0.0.
"I literally cannot sign up. EVERY time I try to sign up it would say ""Sorry, your eligible to sign into zoom at this time."" Simply Annoying."
i was in love with this app it was so smooth and no problem but after I updated this app it automatically swith off video will doing chat or when seeing other apps which make me uncomfortable please clear the issue as soon as possible then it will be 5 star
I would be giving 5 Stars but after the updation when taking chat option or participants my video will off so i hate.. Other all is perfect when the next updation can u change it when taking participants or chat the video... Will not be off for the next updation.....ok
At first when i used it works properly but on a mobile phone but now it stops completely every 2 minutes also it freeze the screen all the time. Not a bad app just got to fix all the bug issues.
Its server is down many days & i have speed for net but it shows no internet connection
I am using this app from 7 months but the app is showing problem because when i am speaking something my voice is not going to the host or other participants and also when I am starting my camera the host and the participants cant see my video on while i can see my own video. So can you please solve this problem?
This app is very nice but the recent updates of this app make it very worst because in the old version when we open any another application while zoom meeting then the video will be paused but now after the update when we are using any another apps during the meeting it will off our video automatically..
As we students use this app for class purpose.I wish it would be good if they add RECORD FEATURE to this. Other screenrecording apps couldn't record voice as it's internet call. So i request them to update recording feature.
When I Go to participatents/chatbox/Mettings settings my video automatically turns off. Its little annoying
I'm student& I'm using this app from 4 month I have face lots of trouble many times is disconnected automatically It has no sense about rotatetion If you minor moves your mobile to left or right than it rotete unwantedly it is major problem about this app It is too lazy and slow It's server is also bad some time we missed our important meetings It has many technical problem and itis repeat repeatedly I am very disappointed and tired from zoom This all are mine experience
Interface design is too much like iOS, please could you make it more android-esque as looks very out of place on an android device. Also interface is glitchy and would be nice to have a virtual background option like iOS
Please don't rotate screen if the auto rotate of the device is turned off. I'm having very much of trouble. At least put a option to change the settings.
Overall it's a good app but whenever I leave the zoom background my video automatically turns off and it also happens when I see the participants list. So fix it as soon as possible.
Could not get audio working at all in Zoom. I verified that my mic works in other video conference apps with no problems
Overall all this app is not bad but i have a problem with speaker and audio that every time I join a meeting its says call over internet and won't allow me to start audio and after a very good net connection.
Im facing the worst experience of zoom. Whenever i start the zoom meeting , in few minutes it get end automatically and start again in few seconds. Because of it creates many problems.
It is not good app it disconnect a lots and vioce of host also crack not able to hear After updating this it become worse app after switching on video when we see in participants it show our video off. After doing sign up if we set a profile picture we are not able to remove that photo there is a option of changing only if the app maker edits the app and add some new features and the optione to remove photo
Sound will NOT work on a chromebook. It drives me insane. Otherwise its fine I guess. Just won't be able to hear anything anyone says.
Tried this on my Android and I could see them and not hear them or hear them and not see my friends, so it was not successful. They could see and hear me, however. It wasn't clear to me how to fix that, I chose the right things for both, but alas.
Please fix zoom Cloud meeting there are so many bugs in it My maam is the host but her screen is like a participant please fix it.if you not fix, the people doesn't use this app and write a review like it is a trash.So now it is in your hand if you fix then people use this app other else we use Google meet.I trust you do it soon.
Using the pen is a problem. It should be made more accessible and controllable. Waiting for host to admit is a major issue.
I 'd like a feature that allows me to block other apps or phone calls when I am in a video call/meeting. No option to use a virtual or blurry background for android users.
Meeting is disconnected, voice is not audible. Its very disgusting
Very bad app in comparison to pc version. Interference, settings, tools etc. can't be customized. It's a kind of minimalist app.
I am just giving it two stars because it uses a lot of internet , the second the voice cuts. Alot , there is a lot of network issue , the video mostly pauses , so I didn't like it at all ,
Why is zoom not working in my part of the area? It's not even showing the main page to report any troubleshoot.
There is a great need of improvement in voice as well video
Video quality is poor nd sometimes i am getting disconnected from the meeting
Whenever in the meeting there is an important talk It shows this free meeting has been ended very frustrating app very much network connection problems hope it will be solved
The baddest experience I've ever experienced! It is disconnecting every time,if network is always good! I'm disappointed with this app!
Uses too much data. 1 gig for an hour? Why can't I choose low Res video? Why can't I choose to view all video participants in gallery mode?
This app is such a trash. Otherwise it always keeps crashing .You will join the meeting and it will crash.It needs a lot of improvement
I had an Important Visit by way of Connecting up to this,but didn't work,an Others have tried to Connect to this also, without any luck,I will give it one (1) more chance before I DELETE IT.
It is good in the beginning bt when tym passes it becomes a poor app with too much of errors..even if it is updated it remains the same nd at that tym there's no option left other than to switch to another app..
I having any problem, now a days in the participants list the cam icon is off every time even though I on my cam. So I request that to see the issue of this.
I am facing a lot of connection issues it goes disconnect again and again
I give it 3 star because it's coming only for 40 minutes and I want it to Come 50 minutes,and all the other facilities are exellent
From one week i have so many connectivity problems in zoom, share option not working and also reconnecting in every 5 minutes ...
"This app is nice...... but sometimes it shows connecting and then back to home shows that ,""you couldn't get connected"".....so Except this zoom is very useful..."
Very bad app, front facing camera on Pixel models now have a significant lighting issue after the most recent update that hasn't been fixed, not sure if it's even been addressed by the developer.
Very bad, I Can't share video, it is locked in my phone but can share in laptop. I can't share docs or share screen as it is locked. Many days ago i put this quiery. But No response from Zoom app.
Before the update came the zoom was fine and ok. then now its so laggy and i cant even tell what my teacher saids when my teacher unmuted me i dont know what to say because the audio was so annoying it always stop i cant even understand a word sometimes the wifi was fine when i reinstall it again the zoom is back to normall when it goes back again sometimes i uninstall it and install every time i just wasted my data for the zoom so many times i just rated 2 stars because there i a big problem.
"I am unable to log in to my account from this Android app. It showing an error ""Oops! We were unable to complete your request. Please try again. (300) """
It's a outstanding app even the connection is great but when I share the screen,the other participants are not able to listen the audio of the video.
It is like a pack of lag and trouble . it always kicks me even tho i hv high speed net , and the quality is worse of camera ,its like i m sitting in dark , voice lags all time plus the msg we send to teacher dont reach at time we expect . Hope this will be corrected ,then only it will get 5 stars ,
I love this app while a month ago but after updating app there are many bugs like if our camera is on than also it is showing off in the participant option and the voice is crashing too muchetc.Please resolve thease issues in the next update
Unable to sign up and create an account.
After the last update I cannot use the Share option of Zoom. Please look into the matter, as because without the Share option using Zoom at the workplace is useless! Please provide a new update soon enough !
I always keep my video on but everytime in participants it always show that it is off and due to that my teachers always scold meÃ°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ 
The reason I changed my review is because if i switch to any app when meeting is for screen sharing my video switches off
The app is fine until last update they did on 21:08:20 anytime i share screen sound will not come. It was so painful pls fix this ASAP thanks. Thanks this problem has been rectify.
I gave only two star because there was a problem when I open this app it doesn't work properly. Whenever there was no sounds & video. But students use this app in lockdown.
I gave a 2star rating becuase its never been smooth using the Zoom app. Itd either i'm not able to commence a meeting, or difficulties in joining one.
With latest version of zoom it's pathetic to trend meeting first when try to join meeting it gives error notable to join report firewall error after restart tab then try some times it work and in between meeting get reconnect /disconnect or shows leave meeting options..
It's hard to navigate between tabs in mobile. And the share button is in a different colour that feels like it has been turned on. So when I try to inshore it that's when I realise its turned off
But after the new update.. Iam not satisfied with it.. And iam not able to change it into the old version in android tab and phone.. Its only available in lap... While we are going to another app or in participants or chat box(while in a meeting ) the zoom is automatically offing our video..
This is a good app but there r so many issues related to it when i installed it in tablet my mic doesn't work but when in pc it works again and again we have to write passwords password are not save for same meeting plzzs solve these problems
The audio has been horrible since the update.
After update we cant pin video easily, videos of participants are not loading clearly and its very laggy and glichfull .
It has many problems like when I click on sign up for creating account then it shows that I'm not eligible to sign up at this time and it's get buffering
This time I updated it was like that only connecting plese wait it will take some momments color was share screen was same microphone was same more was same call over internet was same chat section was same and start video and stop video was also same
this app ia very glitchy when i use it and when i enter zoom, i have to wait for the host to let me, and i can't enter zoom meeting and it keeps on kicking me out and when i use it for meetings it takes all my memory, so i erase this app
No split screen view. Also stop telling me my phone is rooted everytime I open the app, pretty sure I'm not gonna steal my own data buddy.
At first it was all good but after the latest update on zoom which is causing a glitch in my video, although I open my video it shows off in the participants list I hope the problem will be resolved soon
need to improve zoom because sometime my important meeting is goin on and audio problem is major problem so I can't attend meeting
All things were good but my virtual screen option is not coming one day we were doing meeting to learn how to use zoom app they say on virtual option but it is not coming and when we go to participatent list it's show our video is off
I always face a problem when i set my profile picture after setting it when i open it it seems blur..can u tell what is the main issue can u please resolve this if u can't than i will uninstall this app instead m using its updated version but problem is still alive..so please can u kill this problem...
Getting a message that the app is not optimized for my device. Why isn't it? Constantly freezes, very annoying. Would not recommend
Awful sometimes, connections issues and sound gets muted.
Very bad app I don't like because it need too much of net and then the net gets over you may update the app with more details so please do it I am updating but it is as usually
The new update is very bad it takes a whole lot time than it used to, for starting the meeting whenever I click on the meeting link Sent to me It pops up an window and just shows Zoom for all eternity It only starts meeting when I press the notification saying Zoom meeting in progress
This app is the worst totally bad I cant join the meeting everytime its says connection error I have checked my internet connection it is good and stable too. Please fix this apart from that I cant use virtual background please give it.
Zoom is Showing Glitches Nowadays, Draining too much Data and even Though My Video is On, still it's Showing Off in Participants List. Please look for the Problem because it's Difficult to Attend Classes like this.
There is some problem in this app even I have full net connection it takes too much time to join the meeting it irritates and the problem occurs when we join a class.. we are student if it takes too much time we lose a lot of content explained Plzzz solve this problem
Seriously this app needs a de bug It would work properly for some days but after a few time your device is not supported My device has the latest Android version but still I miss my classes just because of this stupidity Fix this!
I'm so disappointed. I updated it so that I can have a virtual background.. but it turns out only adding emojis.. Be fair Zoom, require it to IOS, Android, and PC
This app is good but...the host cant mute the participants without participant's permission...
I am very disapponted to be a host in zoom meeting , i got disconnected several time , And while sharing any image ,document my voice is not audiable to the others,
Very bad app. Keeps connecting and connecting and the voice does not work.
This is a real problem I don't know that I am with an camera on until someone tells me!
All the utubers and webpages say you can play music such as spotify and share. So using an iphone 8+ and P30 pro. We cant do it Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¬. It sucks. Other than that the video works no differently than teams at work So does anyone know for sure how this music sharing works?
This problem of screen flickering during zoom meetings has been present for a few months for a lot of users so why the hell is there still no solution. Be responsive
Always difficult to join the audio. Poor.
"It is a one of the best app for online meetings online class but resentally there is a problem in this app that is when i turn on my ""video"" in gallery view it is shwoing that my video is on but i participants list it is showinv that my video is ""off "" and this is the major problem in it i belive by next update you people will solve this problem and by it the app may became best online meeting app. Thank you. ""Hope the problem will be solved by next update"""
When i upadated this app very bad, the audio quality is of third class nothing is audible....even single word breaks thrice ....
Video quality comes too dark even though I use the same lighting setup. Its very annoying.
There was no problem in zoom but from the recent update if my camera is on in zoom then it is not showing on in participants list. So please fix it fast!!
The video seems not working properly. When I join the meeting, video view is dark or barely visible to participants. Please advise on brightness settings in the app, if any.
Zoom app is good... But from last Thursday it has stuck a problem that my video is on but it is showing off in participant list so nobody can see me... So pls fix this problem so that it doesn't cause any problem again & again
Very bad I can't change my profile pic in new update. Also when I on my video they always show me that my video is off in participant. I haved changed my mobile phone also now I'm ising new oppo latest version still this problem is reoccurring... Kindly note this do the need ful
Please zoom team ; when ever I join meeting it is connected but when I turn on my video it's turned on when I see myself in the scrol but it comes then I go to participants it tells your video is off please fix zoom. Zoom is becoming better too please fix this big please.
Will cause problems like the screen blacking out during playing games and talking with friends
When I was using zoom 1st time it worked successfully
"The zoom meeting i just take the link and preparing meeting in many minutes said ""connection problem"" in other apps the internet stable. Pls fix this app properly"
It was good experience first but after the app update of September. It is gonna mess everything. When I go in participant list it shows my video off but my video is on all time.
This to inform you that our zoom app while in the meeting does not show vedio onn in participate option while it's onn and I can see that my video is onn but others can not see I request you to solve this issue as soon as possible Regards Abhigya Tiwari Zoom user Pls solve our problems if your team will solve it when I will give 5 star and I will take my complaint back
There are bugs in app i have switched on my video but still in participant list is showing that video is off and I like this app but there should be virtual background for Android users also.Thats why i am giving only 2 stars
Worst app There is no network problem but showing network error
Im a teacher, It was a nice app, but now when i click on participants, it shows my video off and its really annoying, this happened from today only, otherwise it was fine, and yes ntwrk issues are always there with this app...
Resolve battery heating issue and due to that battery of mobile soon Discharge, many of my friends suffering from this issue.
I can't hear anything. The audio is pretty badde need help
The app used to work fine, but the the camera is way too dark for to see my face, making extremely hard to use during meetings when I can't use my computer
Screen is not sharing after update
This is very bad aap chii
I connect to bluetooth headphones with my HP laptop zoom never works !!! My wifi network disconnects and I'm out of the meeting
Video quality is very boring audio quality too.
Just I feel its very bad experience.
The media volume should be independent from call volume and also call volume shouldn't be dominant all the time it really irritates a lot. Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜
Pls tell me how set picture as a profile on zoom. This app is sucessful appÃ°Å¸â€˜Â
Their is a bug in this version. Whenever i turn my Video on i don't see whether front or rear camera is on and another thing it still shows your video is off while other person is able to see what i am showing
Nice but give the recoding settings in the app
Incorrect time zone information from Bali, no Bali time zone. Changes the time to an hour later, or my time to an hour earlier. Times don't sync correctly. Only give Jakarta a the time zone here.
It is good but it is consuming more data.
This app is useful and helpful i like this app but sometimes connections is out.
Not so good ...
When the update latest then ot is not comfortable in meeting when we go in participants option we can see our video is off but we have kept it on and in school batch teacher scolds.Plese improve this fault of video in participants is off.
I have signed up but my profile doesn't appear
It's good but I have some problem l don't remember the the password to make me organization so l give only 1 Ã¢Â­Â
Not bad
Today why I can't join meeting I update it but I can't join the meeting today is my important class reply me zoom. Us
When many participants have activated their videos, the app crashes constantly, especially during a crucial moment. This is annoying, but I have never recieved such an issue earlier. I request the developers to look into this.
This is great aap
Nothing much praising
These app very super
Okay
Improve more by emojis
Ther is no recording facility can you add this
There are so many problem ther have error when video is on in the participants list it's off and teachers started scolding straight away, there is much error in this app
Video off while sharing PPT and when check the participants. It's unprofessional
I am getting some problem that my video shows switch off but its on,
It is very nice app it is very usefull for meetings conducted by every day
Very very worst meeting app . I study in TECHNO INDIA GROUP PUBLIC SCHOOL . I MUST BE REGULAR IN CLASS . EVERY MORNING THE APP GETS SIGNED OUT. FOR LAST 3 DAYS I AM LATE FOR MY FIRST CLASS AND I AM GETTING SCOLDING FROM MY PARENTS AND MY TEACHERS. Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¬Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¬Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¬Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡. Sometimes I am being marked absent. For no other reason but for this reason.
It not work at the time. Its very disgusting
I gave it 2 stars because their customer support team has not responded to my billing issue for 2 months. Of course they blame covid 19.
Zoom is good but the zoom limit is only 40 Min that why zoom is not good very much
I am having problem connecting audio in my meetings but my all settings are all right please fix this very big problem.
This is a worst app I have seen in my life.It is taking so much data for my online classes , for 1 hour the data it is is sucking is 300mb from my 2gb data so I have understood that you have to have a WiFi-rooter otherwise it sucks more data from us.Its features are good but it is very lagging and joins the meetings very slowly even if I have strong data then also it joins me in the meetings slowly. I am in 8th class so please sort out the issue make zoom better
Not really great Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¢
Very bad app. I am unable to listen host audio,even the host unmuted me.
The voice is not clear
Connectivity is next to impossible to establish. Using this creates more problems...go away.
Sucks for meetings.
I can't add my pic to the app, its little annoying
The GUI is really bad, and it kinda feels awkward to use, and sometimes it doesnt work.
Improve a participant chang background.
It is a good app
It is sucking up too much datas. For users without WiFi routers like me.
Zoom app is not downloading
Nice app! Now I can get online classes with help of this app! Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¡ This app's vidio quality is very nice! The team is doing nice workÃ°Å¸â€˜Â!
I've noticed that as I've downloaded the latest version of Zoom on my mobile devices, it no longer has the Virtual Background feature. If you could please include the Virtual Background feature in the next update, I would appreciate it. Thanks
hard to apply network to local social media
Well, I've been trying to download this app for about 15 minutes, and I am a student who needs to get on rn but my laptop is dead! So two star because I've been on the app on my laptop and it's good for meetings, but it won't download here.
Its good
Zoom please connect meeting with loss connection of wifi
Good Nice
I face a problem with this app...! I do turn on my video during my classes but it shows I haven't turned my video on in participants list..
It is nice but not prefact let's see in next update ...In very quick time it need update so please try to make this app best
need to develop
Very nice
Bad app, unable to connect meeting
When I connect to a meeting my audio not automatically get connected but I have gone to setting and I done auto connect audio but it not get connected please fix it
There is a little problem, when my video is on it always says that video is off and today the host remove from the meeting. Why?
Good excellent
I updated onwards my video is not coming in participants please check the problem and please update once the zoom app
1.The network connection is good but it's showing the network is poor. 2. I have signed in but today it's showing to sign in again . 3. I use it for my online class but if another participant have a little bit of network problem it is restarting the meeting. And it causes so much data
We could not come to put profile photo that why I am giving you only Two stars only
Waste at all consuming more data
Sometimes it impulsive coming out from the meeting and it's not rejoining also then I should leave the meeting and I should rejoin, then it impulsive disconnet my audio , I can't hear what the host is coaching and and there should be a option after joining the meeting they cant leave the meeting by them self only the host should end the meeting and if the host is favoured to unmute the option should not come and finally there should be no option to disconnect the audio.
Well this app is not good at all
There is a problem from 2-3 months that even if my video is on it shows in the participant list my video is off. My teachers say me turn on your video,but my video is on only. Please look into the issue at the earliest.
Cannot maximum video screen after updating to the latest version
This app is nice for meetings but it sucks in video quality..i don't like to use zoom.. I prefer to google meet inspite of zoom..
My situation made me to choose this. I think you should upgrade to Chromecast to big screens.
I can not sign in my facebook account in this thing
In my tab this app suck it give me erro all the time
Wallpaper is not there in mobile
Why can't I download it?
This app always showing report problem...... I not able to listen classes
Sorry
It always disconnected during my class but some features are pretty good thats why it got 2 Stars
Super veiw
Until today where it forcefully kicked me out of my Japanese class just to update. Lucky nothing to important happened while I was kicked out. But it should never have forcefully updated without my permission, and never should have kicked me out, for an update that wasn't even nessasary to update for.
incorrect password error occur ..while pw is already correct .. facing this issue

Some time it's laggy, and disconnected

This zoom app is not so good. It keeps logging me out whenever I log in. And it always keep reconnecting no matter how good the network is.
This app easy to useÃ°Å¸â€™Â¥Ã°Å¸â€™Â¥Ã°Å¸â€™Â¥ but it contains lot of internetÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡. Please resolve this problem Ã°Å¸â€™Å½Ã°Å¸â€™Å½Ã°Å¸â€™Å½Ã°Å¸â€™Å½Ã°Å¸â€™Å½Ã°Å¸â€™Å½

It's was a better app
Not nice app very bad app
The worst app i have ever used don't recommend this app at all
Virtual background is not available
After the latest update its literally sucking data like lightning speed... Within one hour almost 1 GB is taken away...
Wow very good
I am unable to start a meeting. Error received ( host has ended the meeting)
Too worst
Average
Good but only good for 45 minutes unless you upgrade & upgrade is too costly.
it requires a lot more than 40 mb of internal storage (at least 1GB) to download
MEETINGS NOT JOIN
Bad app, It takes much time to send or receive voice It takes my phone over heat
It takes alot of time
Great
This is very best for taking online classes. As per my experience it's good
I cant join in a meeting and the next, it says App unavailable at this time. I've checked my connection, I've uninstalled and reinstalled, I've checked my memory space all to no avail. It works when it wants to. I've missed many church meetings as this is the only way to connect. Now its very bad.
It sucks and terrible quality
Worst app ever .... When i click in participent and chat my camera got automatically of...
It's great but I can't be a n host that is why I put 2 stars
Virtual background option not show in my phone
Zoom is take use to mobile data is more use to

I can't open it
Cannot like
Okk
The app requirs more data
I am getting that this device is not supported.
Worst app y because not clarity in both audio and video
This bappb not doing well When ever i put oassword for class but class is not working
School
This is a useful app, especially during the pandemic. However, it is much too complicated and should be easier to operate for those who are not as tech savvy. For example, the icon buttons are not as helpful as they should be and you should have a feature that allows you to save meetings for later, and frequently visited meetings should be saved in history.
"Only a 2 rate for me because when I try to sign up it says, ""You are not eligible to join Zoom"""
Cant see.
Very bad app, always glitching!!! Meetings are always dark in camera and blotchy in sound
Very good for meetings
Does not give the satisfaction of a true meeting I dont recommed this app
Not joining to meeting
Amazing to connect with friends and family Connection need improvement
Overheating device
Why 3 setting is not coming

Hope everyone can use it hahahahahahah
Excellent
My profile pic just jumped off and I can not seem.
When I open another app for use my video automaticly close.
"I am really disappointed.....reason for the disappointment is that, the app automatically crashes when it says ""your internet con is unstable"". Then i have to manually rejoin the meeting.. this is really disturbing. Hope you fix thisÃ°Å¸ËœÂ§Ã°Å¸ËœÂ§"

Its kinda hard to log in
2 stars because the video quality is bad, it overheats my devices and kills my battery 2x faster than normal. Also remove the feature of the host being able to control what your doing because that is very inconvenient.
Not so smooth app
Very bad app is consuming lots of data when the video is on but still the image is blur
Video quality are back to the low class after new updates
The sound doesn't work .
Fabulous for cheating in exams Ã°Å¸Â¤Â£
Getting out and in during metting not much good app

Add a feature of screen orientation
This App is glitching like it doesn't start when I click on it and the sound quality is pretty bad
I hate it, so simple, no details, I'd rather gmeet
That's a nice app but all picture are clear but only my picture is mirror, whyÃ¢Ââ€œÃ¢Ââ€œ
It don't work with my wifi properly... Rest all others apps at that time work normally...
Please improve its compression utility and add chat block feature during meeting so that i cant get msg and not require to mute chat all time. Alsoo add data saving mode.
I like it when I get this app it helps me very much

This is a good app but the reason which made me give 2 star is the suggestion is if there was a virtual reality even in mobile then it will good and you could have made seeing more than four screens at a time
Very poor service
Good but not has much

"Hi! This app is good but for the past 8 months since I have been using it, this app doesn't accept my internet and I have missed so many classes because of that I mean google works well in my internet and when I try to connect this app just goes ""oh sorry there IS AM UNKNOWN ERROR"""
I can't hear anything
My problems is that when we enter class I turn my video in my class but when I open my participation then it close plz repair
Bad app, buggy volume and video
Difficult to connect
I mean you can play with other people but you need it for like people for 4 years old
There is no better connection in zoom while during class niether internet connection or not ...so 2stars
Good only
Good experience with zoom app
For the price I pay, this is severely lacking. On the whiteboard, I can't copy and paste text or images. Enabling original sound is complicated. 1 GB of cloud storage is a joke. A paid account should come with 100GB minimum. I can't adjust the size of other screens on mobile. On PC, I can't adjust the size of screens at all when sharing my screen. The chat often disappears when sharing my screen (it didn't use to). On PC, I should be able to use two cameras simultaneously. Now at character limit
Would've rated it 5 stars but I have some problems. I always get disconnected while I'm in class, everything freezes before I get disconnected then I wait to join again but it doesn't connect me to class. I had times when I waited for 20 minutes and it still didn't connect me. I don't have any connection problems cause my sister is in the same class but nothing happens to her. I would be happy if this issue gets fixed. I would be happy if you respond.
It is good at everything but I found a new update in zoom. It is if we go to participants or chat the video will be off. I hope that you will make some more changes and the video should be continuing if we go to participants and chat. There is another problem that is sometimes if my network connection is good also I am disconnected from the meeting. Except this I didn't find any problem with zoom. THANK YOU
Great application and has a variety of uses. That being said, multiple people and myself are not able to listen to a zoom conference through a Bluetooth speaker on our phone. It's dumb. They should fix that. It says Bluetooth is connected but it still plays through my phones audio.
I am adding a new review to this... My sister was trying 5o organize a prayer group! But I soon learned that as a group , on my side when we prayed together it was sounding like a gargling contest! The sounds brown up , especially when she rung bells and talked at the same time! Of course she said that did not happen to her! Perhaps because she uses a lap top or computer! I use a hand held tablet.
Only use for one to one conversations with friends and family... Despite the one and two star reviews, I've had no real issues, other than the expected early use problems in getting used to the app and the settings, and worked how to get the audio and video to start...(doesn't seem to automatically activate audio and video when you join a meeting, or ring to let me know someone has joined a meeting) so - 1Ã¢Ëœâ€ , also -1Ã¢Ëœâ€  for the non-existent customer support
Yeah this is good now (Zoom) , but an extra features should be added like... 1) Most of the students are going out of the zoom screen and simply playing games as no sound audible for the teacher who is teaching , so this can be fixed by applying an additional code , when a student go out of the screen , it should be notified by teacher, and.. 2) video Quality is the most problem 3) please make sure this facility available for the host --> Show the network status of all participants
It is the good app but some problem are there with the app:- 1. While using the app it showing no internet connection. 2. I can't connect properly and again and again I was left my online classes but the network and net connection is working properly in other app. 3. In chat section there is a problem with me in sending picture and media. There after the main issue is the clearance of voice and vedio quality is not good but it can be better than it.
Probably a good appÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â...but one problem will make me feel bad about this app is that when I on my video on this app then after looking into participants option means in the background my video which is on seems to be off still...that's why my teacher always doubt me that I have not turned my video on...so please I request you to fix this issue as soon as possible Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â
Was alright at start, but the the app itself is ok. But there are a lot of bugs and issues which sometimes causes problems. The nice thing is that it works good on old devices. Overall nice but needs some improvements.
They're asking me to pay an additional $4.99 when I already paid $149.00 for the product. I should not be asked for any more money just because I have a new device. Additionally I am no longer able to use whiteboard. I am also unable to see my students.
it is really slow and needs way too many updates. I was trying to download on my iPad while my computer was updating. it working really slow. my iPad is also a new model so I know it is zooms problem.
Its a good app but there is a problem that whenever I go to settings to change my profile or more, it gets change but after two days it gets hidden and there comes that there's no option.Refresh, and when i tap the button to refresh it dosen't refresh so...i have to switch off my phone for 1 hour.Pls fix this problem otherwise it will be a nice app to work.
This is good cloud meeting. But it always disconnected when an important meeting is going on. And when I connect it , it written network problem. So please check it. And also please reply me. And also change the settings of lock the meeting room ( if I was disconnected and I restart my phone and again want to join it was written this metting is locked by the host) please change if you changing it I will give you a 5 stars Hope you will favour me
Its very difficult for me and every one cause its always been sticking and cutting off so thats why i am constantly complaining cause its giving every one a very hard time during the crisis so i want something better zoom is good but not that good so u should creat an app that you can connect with out adress and all other things so thats really why i gave it the amount of stars and i think people will give it that amount of stars to and i hope you create even a better and lasting zoom than that
Am... A good app but this is very difficult to connect even when my network is working on other app but not working on it . This created many problems . Due to this my atendence is geting low and low. Please help me to resolve this issue. And its an humble request to the zoom Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€Ã°Å¸Â¥Âº There is an issue that camera's icon is not thier help me please!!!!!! This is created many problem Hope you can solve it as soon as posible
I like the app, it's so good to talk and have a meet, even for studying, but I have a problem. When I want to watch something with my boyfriend, like a movie, i can't share my audio, and he can. We both use Android but idk why I can't share mine. If you could solve that I'll give 5 stars to it. Thx
Zoom is providing free meetings for online classes in this pandemic. But I do wanna suggest you a thing about developing your app. - Change the UI of the app so that it'll be liked by everyone. - Also add an option in the settings menu to autostart a scheduled zoom meeting. - Change the designing of the total app. - Also add an update of zooming others video. If you do this you can get good rating and I'm sure of it.Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€° Expecting a lot from you..
After the last update, my audio doesnt connect automatically anymore. I rechecked my meeting settings but the audio still didnt connect automatically.
Everything is good so far but when it comes to the chat in a meeting, if we post a message to everyone instead of posting it privately, we can't delete it. We are just doomed if it is an inappropriate message. I request zoom to add a delete option to the messages in a meeting chat box.
"I faced some issues about zoom. When I attend class it gets disconnected suddenly and says ""Sorry zoom got crashed unexpectedly""... . It's so disappointing to wait during ur class time."
I haven't used the app yet so this isn't a real rating but I'm having a problem. I'm trying to sign up for zoom but I put my birthday and it says that I am not eligible for signing up for zoom at this time. Please get back to me and try to fix this because I have a meeting in two weeks that I promised I'd attend. Thanks, Kemirah
Hey there nice app everything is great I am a student but not only me but my classmates also face a problem when we open some option in zoom app unfortunately the vedio turns off and if we quit zoom also vedio off it is important to quit zoom because we have to do work from other apps so fix this problem and thanks for creating this app I will give it five star if you can fix this problem in your next update. Thanks
Ya It's a good app but we have to face many problems. Many times basic disappeares and we are not able to change name . Isn't this correct? It says the zoom is up to date but in many phones many new advantage comes but not still in many..... Please Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ» try to repair such promblems . Otherwise this app is best for connecting during the lockdown or if we are very very far... Thanks for creating such an app... Thanks again
This is one of the best app for online meetings. It has been a very nice experience using zoom app. Just one problem is that we cannot record the meeting or see any notification on mobile.
Not optimized for Android Tablet (Tab S7+). It give the same experience and functionality as a Phone. I hope they can modify the app to maximize the additional screen on tablets.
It has less number of options or facilities when compared to that of zoom app used in windows... You can't record the meeting, can't use virtual background,can't use video filters...
But sound was an issue. It was my first time trying this app and it just does not seem to work all that great. Sad that it is widely used and it has such clear major problems.
Love the app just three problems 1. I have tried over 20 times to reset my password but never worked when I pressed to reset password link I put in my new password but told me it was incorrect and I can't use my email because I'm trying to get my account on my school computer and I can't add accounts on their 2. On my computer my share screen does not work even if I have permission it just grays out the share option 3. When I'm trying to talk to my friends on it randomly stops I know you guys di
The phone app does not work right. It is hard to join and start meetings, and most of the time even when I do the steps correctly I get a black screen that says it is loading the meeting that never goes away and the meeting never starts. This is a problem because it interferes with my job. It needs to be corrected.
With the latest update, one bug has came that even if in settings the option that auto connect to audio is on the also when we join a meeting we have to connect to audio ourselves. I don't like it a little bit also.
I would give this application a 5, but for God's sake, can you please remove the screen autorotation?? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a heck of a problem and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let me join the meetings with ease. You might add a rotate button just like the speaker/earphone button. PLEASE!!
Im very sorry to give u 3 star. Please remove the lower volume limitatation sometime when i use head set its still too loud, even when i lower the volume it got a limit to lower your volume, please remove that. Sorry for bad english. I will change the rating later if u do that
What I dont like about this mobile version is when I minimize this app for more than two minutes, it will then close automatically. It was not like this with its previous versions.
I actualy like this app but, sometimes i can't join the zoom meetings i dont know why. I've tried several times but still can't join the zoom meeting. And even if i report it i still can't join. And i cant study well because of that. So may i know why did this happen? Please fix it right now because im going to use it........
Good app but i have a problem if my net is very fast but then also the person who is telling anything in the app to me her voice is cracking too much and when I go to another app my video get off inspite of getting paused and I have many problem with that so plzz fix this problem its a humble request plz plzz plzzzzz
It is missing very important features, like it cannot switch the camera on while multitasking ehivh in important in assessments. Additionally, it has server issues and often crashing thus, meetings are missed. Lastly, you cannot receive files in chat box which is very annoying!
I enjoy using zoom on my pc. But app not what I need I pay for cloud storage service but if I need to record when not home this app comes unless. I feel there should be a pro app if you pay for a subscription where you can record and save to the cloud. Also any chance making pc and mac version able to work with OBS , So I can make some cool YouTube videos Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€ 
This app is usalley great when I put vitural events or want to video chat. However tonight i wanted to do a vitural event and I put in the passcode over 10 times and it said the wrong one. I double and tripled check to make sure I put the right one in.
A good app for online meetings. But I am rating 3 stars because once I logged out of zoom I was unable to login again. Whenever I tried to login it shows that you are not eligible to sign in zoom at this timeÃ°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ .l hope you will fix this problem in your updation. Thanking you in anticipation Ã°Å¸â€˜â€¹Ã°Å¸â€˜â€¹
Too many issues on my Android phone. Unable to turn on my microphone or hear others. Audio was a huge problem on my most recent call.
Zoom was the worst app I ever used but nowadays it has improved a lot. I want to give one star but the rapid improvement in the app forced me to give 3 stars to it. I wanted to give two but one more to boost its confidence and improve in the coming days.
The October update is not up to mark , if we see the participation list then our video is turning off , if running zoom in background also turns out video off , so please work on it bcz we have to give test and if video is turned off then we will be marked absent.
"I am using this app it is well but now l cannot sign up again with another email a note appears ""You are not eligible to sign up now"".l tried so many times a day but same note appears. I would have given 5 star rating if l am not driven into this issue.l hope you may help ."
After update, it disconnect again and again... Last review: The basic account criteria should be at least 60 mints. Kindly enhance. It consumes too much mobile battery and also heat up the mobile...
1) It was a good Ã°Å¸â€˜Âapp for online classes (or) any cloud meetings but some times it is not receiving signals Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¢ from host to participants. 2) Some times video Ã°Å¸â€œÂ¹ is not clear, and we are not getting perfect voice from the host. 3) Please fix this problems Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€ Immediately. ___Thank you___ Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â
New to zoom so today is first time. Going to take a few times to get it down, I'm sure trial and error will make it a distant memory. Enjoyed being on zoom. With the Holidays coming up we hope to get on zoom and all of us can stay safe. I also want to be apart of my ward meetings.
in the first 5 minutes everything went smoothly, but when the meeting started. the video already shows the initial sign of lagging, then suddenly Disconnected, and it will happen again and again until I feel fedup to join the meeting.at last i miss alot of information...
I tried changing my background. But even after switching on the virtual background button in settings of my account in zoom website, the virtual background button in more settings of my android zoom app is missing. Kindly resolve the issue. Thank u :)
The app is good and has good features but please provide a feature through which we can keep the screen either on portrait or landscape according to our will and the screen doesn't tilt with when we rotate or tilt our phone.
If you are the host it is terrible. I'm a teacher and rely heavily on many of the multitasking features in the desktop app. Several of them are not present here on the mobile app. I am on Samsung Tab S7. I thought DeX mode would solve my issues, by allowing me to run the full version. What I need: Ability to have participants and chat panel open at all times Share computer sound Never loose my video when sharing screen Music or computer sound only
For Android tablet, perhaps Zoom could allow the onscreen function icons (microphone, camera, etc) to always stay on and not disappear. Also, for the icons to be a bit larger. This would be very helpful to a senior citizen.
Doesn't default to gallery mode or show option with 2 attendees. You have to click on participant name to get mute/unmute/stop-video widget and it goes back to showing name after a few seconds (Chromebook environment).
This app is very good. But the only problem is whenever I sign in, it doesn't stable more than a week. So fix this problem. Other things is okay.
You guys are working hard to keep up with the sudden popularity and I appreciate that. However, I forgot to adjust the year when entering my age so you locked me out of making an account when I had my first zoom appointment that day :/ Doesn't make any sense when you know children are being told to use your platform nationwide anyway. Thanks for hearing me out.
Hay ZOOM on Android doesn't have the option to see as many screens as WINDOWS devices or APPLE? I love this app, but when using a CHROMEBOOK or a tablet or phone it bothers me that I can only see 4 screens per page.
It is not clear how to use this app. I had no trouble the first time i used it. Now everything does not work. Need to download a ewer version. Use an id and meeting number use link andnothing gets me into meeting which i totally missed .
Its a very nice app. But I want to say that a girl name uroscopy always enters in our online class and disturb us. When our mam looks her in participant list he leaves immedietly. Today also she came and we ask her name but she told us that you can't know my name. It's my request to you that plz find that girl/hacker and inform me as soon as possible. Thank you
There's this bug where it says my camera is on but it isn't. I get shouted by my teacher because my she says I'm turning my camera off even though it clearly says it's on. Please fix this stupid bug. Would not recommend using this app.
When I am in a meeting and if I need to call a person the phone will hang and the screen will freeze.What to do? Please solve the problem and I am using redmi note 8 with Android 10 version and I am having 104gb space out of 128gb . From my side no problem.Please I request zoom team to solve this problem as soon as possible Ã¢ËœÂ¹Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ËœÂ¹Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â
But virtual backgrounds don't work on some devices that should be capable. The Surface Duo, for example.
Like in Windows, Android should have option to always show the bottom bar, also there should be option to pin video like in Windows Also, noticed that the chat window does not rotate when phone is rotated There should be option to disable emojis for kids or have a kids profile with options to customize
One problem with this app is when my teacher unmutes me when I want to answer a question , I can't unmute myself and there is no option coming that 'The host want to unmute you' and cannot I unmute myself or if the opton comes and I unmute myself my teacher can't hear my voice and microphone in the participants list mine was also showing blank means if a person talks it becomes green but when I spoke in unmute mode in front of the microphone the mic sign doesn't turned green.PLS RECTIFY THIS.
There are huge bugs in this app.While I am using sim card internet for attending Zoom meetings,it strucks for 10 seconds a time.You should make a smooth network usage for attending Zoom meetings.We know that YouTube can give us a smooth network experience.You should get to the level of YouTube or above the level. This is only the Huge Bug.
Hard time hearing each other sound fades in and out, even when the mute button is off, these calls are very important we use for Church meetings, bible studies, it sometimes not clear most of the time And we need them for Doctor visit's.
There many problems please because when I see in participants my camera show off and when I go to another app my camera automatically off also but sometime it's Keep disconnected and I need to change my wifi again
It would be much better if I would be able to record my meetings using this app, cause I am a teacher and I need to upload the classes after finish, but it is the 1st I use this app and I couldn't find the recording in any part of my storage.
Obviously a port of the iPhone app with no UI changes. Works fine, just the UI looks out of place when compared with most Android apps. Material UI would look much better.
I am feeling uncomfortable while using this app. While attending meetings I got a lot of problems. When someone start to talk then they so there screen which makes difficult . Try to solve this problem.
I am facing an issue When I tried to join a meeting , it was asking me for the passcode , Even though I joined the meeting through the link , which was given to me. I entered the right passcode and yet it's saying it's incorrect I checked the passcode many times ( which was there in the invitation message that was with me ) and tried 9 times to get in But it was still saying me the passcode is incorrect
Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€It is good but sometime I'm facing lots of problem just like when I'm trying to connecting that it is showing only connecting but after some time they are sending a error code which is the wasting the time and some time i didn't attended the meeting which was most important for me.
The zoom app is excellent but, they should give the feature of virtual background in phone also, I am using the premium one but still I am not able to access that feature in mobile phone, please make it work as soon as possible.
I deducted one star because meeting can't be done more than forty min if you are not a premium member you have to rejoin again and again after every 40 min.... Also plz prepare virtual background for the mobile version ....
It was working well,but know not connect to internet and not allowing me access to my meetings. They are saying that my access is blocked by firewall but don't understand the reason.
It is good , but from many days I am facing a problem that my camera is on but in participants option it shows off . Please fix this problem then I will not have any hesitation in giving you 5 stars .. Ã¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­Â
It's Great App with amazing potential but I'm highly disappointed because yesterday I could not hear anything, there was no Audio at all, I could not hear the Facilitator from the Meeting.I also didn't hear any participants Ã°Å¸ËœÂ
Its a great app especially for students doing school at home but when the meeting ends and your trying to rejoin it keep on saying wrong meeting ID and passcode which i dont like so the creaters of the app needs to fix it.
When I use the facility auto connect audio and on the facility call over internet I thought it will work. And it worked. But when I updated it previously after that it is not working. You should fix this issue as soon as possible. Thankyou.
I would have rated it 5 star but the only problem I and face is,when we turn off auto-rotate in our mobile it is still adjusting to potrait. Except this problem zoom didnt troubled me any time I like zoom.Tnq zoom
I have 2 complain that is 1.Sometime it not work when the meeting is start but I can see meeting is not start where ever. 2.Please change the settings when we go to another app the video should not closed
This update is vey bad......Camera quality , mic quality,internet connection are having so much problems . Please Fix this problem.before. the update this app was best,but after.....Ã°Å¸ËœÅ’Ã°Å¸ËœÅ’Ã°Å¸ËœÅ’
It's a good app for education but sometimes it occurs to much problem..while muting or unmutting ;mean while then to its a nice app keep it up...and try to update some new...Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
I was unable to join a meeting, I put my correct password and email but was still unable to join because it says that I put the wrong password or email, but my only problem for now. Im not sure if something is wrong or if its the app. That's all
This was a very useful app for me . I had rated only 3 stars because, for 40min class, it uses more than 100Mb.So, that's why I had rated only 3 stars
The video quality is so good, I appreciate that but there is no option from touching up our appearance Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š, hope you will add this feature in next update, in fact the touch up appearance option in my laptop but not in my phone Ã°Å¸â€œÂ±
Chrome says to download the app then sends you to a link to a version that doesn't support breakout rooms. A bit confusing using on a Dell Chromebook
The app was going good for first few days but I'm not able to join a meeting using the link,,, I always need to go to zoom n give meeting id n pass code...... This irritates me all the time
A great app for online classes , etc.And make sure that without sign in we can keep photos that's why I am giving 3 star. I have liked your app it's awesome.
Lots of freezing up. Had to restart the app many times. Directions are often too confusing.
I am facing some issues and also i can't record using screen recording , sound will not record, so I am facing some issues
Whenever I start using zoom it blocks my microphone from all other apps even if i dont join the auduo, which extremely annoying. Thats not to even mention the occasional bugs it has.
Very Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½bad app at first I like this app when I tried to become host and when tried to sign up and i set my date of birth and sai set then it tell you are not agible to become host but i can join meetings but i can't became host that's why I am giving it three Ã¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­Âstar's
Only shows 4 people per screen unlike the PC where you see much more on the same screen. Very disappointed why it can't be the same
Yes it is a good app for buisness and online meetings but I not give him five star because it has some complications Like we have to use this app for online class by meeting ID and password So it's have se fault from side But it a temporary good app for any other meetings
For some reason on android you can only see 4 people at a time on gallery on apple you can see loads, it's really frustrating, why not add this to android
My only issue is that I can't create breakout rooms on the mobile app. I have the ability to join, but as a host, I dont have the ability to create.
Its the hardest out of them all why couldn't people use Skype or discord.
Nicely developed app.. only for zoom in mobile it should be little more like changing of background and sometimes playing video by sharing screen video is not audible to anyone in meeting.
It's the best app for meetings and online classes but I m not able to sign in even when I have my correct password and email address.I request zoom app to fix this problem as soon as possible
Voice frequently became silent (while host was still talking). Lost complete meeting & rebooted back to meeting without my assistance. It was my 1st time attending this meeting & I lost a lot of pertinent information.
"Virtual background is now supported for my Samsung galaxy m51 thank you Zoom.. But ""DEVICE SOUND SHARING "" is not working IN *MS POWER POINT* (PPT).. & give ppt sharing option, like documents."
It has on occassions been irratic. Last week I lost the ability to be heard halfway through a session.
Very good, but you've swiped the sound playing from my laptop external speakers so that they now only work when zoom is being used and not for my meditation music.
That good and it allows 100 participates and I have enjoyed and I use it for online classes some times it will trouble in before version but in this version its good and I think its need more improve than this thats good
it is amazing but it glitches out sometimes especially with music but other wise awesome you also can't hear other people somtimes I suggest you download it but I did tell you what happens sometimes
Not really good. Somtimes its giving problem not able to join the webinar. It keep on showing connecting and not able to join the webinar. Solve fix on it.
The app has many issues like Audio issues and Disconnection issues I cannot hear the voice neatly because there is a pause in voice of every person and using this app my device is overheating. its very disgusting
Half of the time it was lagging for me and it was really hard concentrate on what happening in the meeting It has its advantages and disadvantages.
I am giving 3 stars because when l enable mirror my video then anything l show like copy looks tilted and when l disable it then the actions l do looks tilted Like when l raise my left hand it shows right hand that's all.Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€™Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€”
Audio and video as good as device and connection speed using. Have had both good and bad experiences with Zoom on both PC and tablet.
Zoom is good but the problem is that during meetings when i open the participants list and open the chat box my video gets off this the major problem i am facing so, please fix my problem fast... Three Ã¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­Â stars for this nice app.
This is a very good app because it's help a lot during pandemic. The reason I have given 3 stars is that it disconnect again n again during my online classes plz do something for this problem
zoom please put a 'lock' mode where how you touch the screen it wont have any impact and it cab avoid accidentally opening mic and cam. its like when you lock video
WORST!!! CAN'T REVIEW!!! BUT THE APP INVENTERS DON'T IMPROVE. NOW ALSO YOU ARE WORKING HARD AND THE UPDATE COMES AFTER A MONTH OR IN BETWEEN SOMETIMES, BUT THE USERS ARE NOT HAPPY. YOU CAN SEE NOW THAT YOU MAKE SMALL EFFORTS AND THE UPDATE COMES BUT IT GOES IN VAIN.
This app is great and all but theres a problem... when i tilt my phone it switches automatically if i can lock the screen to not switch i would give it five stars
Very good app but it doesn't work sometimes and because of that my daughter faced problem a lot of times so plz look into it...!!
It's keep on saying incorrect passcode, this is really strange and needs to be fixed please.
I like this app. It is very important to see the online classes. But audio was not working. So that is the problem in this app. So try to change this problem. I don't like this app Ã°Å¸Â¤Â®
Zoom app is nice but one problem in meeting in my phone . During the meeting,I have not shared screen. So, give soluntion.
I can't access my virtual background . Reinstalled. Went to account setting via browser to enable. Didnt work. No resolved
I am giving 3 stars to zoom bec in between there is a lot of internet problem is there so please don't forget to fix this type of things thanks for creating zoom app !!+
Had issues with PAYMENT that the customer service they will get back to me...they never did. Had to cancel my sub
This is a good app but after the new upgrade I have facing a problem that the auto connect to audio function is not working so please fix I faced a lot of problems due to not working of auto connect to audio function
Tha app is good but it should improve their audio and video quality. You should also add some privacy in the app . Otherwise the app is very nice
It was an osm app until I updated it. After the last update, I don't know why - but I can't share screen now while meeting. Can u help me please...... Wanna give 5 star.... But after the issue is solved. Hoping......
The reason i gave 3 stars is because whenever i go in a meeting, others cameras always stays frozen. Sometimes i get disconnected even with good wifi.
"The voice quality is bad and the designation about the options there is really difficult and not easy to use like I don't know why I can't talk with it says ""call over internet"""
When you go to participants then your video will be off..
Would be nice if you could have more that 4 on the grid view ...also when using this app with Samsung Dex, it doesn't allow me use the camera in landscape mode
It works best but it is showing a bit problem in mike and now it's not connection . Meeting is not in progress . Plzx fix it .
It will some some time it struck and it will say connections problem if it not there so iam giving three star and we donot have permission to record the sreen and sreenshare permission so i am giving three star
This app is like having someone behind listening and taking note of your conversations. Besides, that is very dishonest from this company.
There is a problem in the video option that sometimes it shows in the participant list that the video is off while it is on
Pls. Make it smoothest and error free we are facing lot of issues in our lectures Lagging problem is the first with audio and video problem with screen sharing.
Its ok app but not perfect, it is the worst video quality i ever seen, there are bugs and glitches, try to fix it.
Uses a lot of data in 40 mins only It uses more than 500 mb in 40 mins Buggy app I get kicked out of meeting while I am connected to wifi. Several voice cuts/mutes... Its very bad
This app is great as long as the connection is good but either the internet has a problem of dropping participants or the app is faulty.
No problem best app but from past few weeks there are major problems in it video is turned on but when we go in participants then it is showing off plzz fix this problem plzzzzzzzzz
Always settings are changing. not able to listen anything . when the app updated then onwards i am facing this problem. I hope u will fix this problem.Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â
Very nice Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’ and useful app but in this app using 200 MB for 45 minute so in school class have 4 lecture per day. Per day using 800 MB in 1GB. So please do 50 to 100 MB for 45 minute.please..please..please..act on this.......
My experience was good the only issue for which I rated it 3 Star was due to lack of lock orientation.....they should provide lock orientation option
It's good to interact but in phone also there should be option to change the background, do makeup and all option which we can access on Laptop or Computer
I can't hear audio
During meeting when I tap on speaker icon at top left corner to mute the audio of the meeting but it doeas not mute the audio instead it reduce the volume.
This app is really good but whenever I join the meeting , the meeting will close in every 20 min and get time to start.
An important communication tool to have now ever since the pandemic. It could help if it is a little bit more user friendly..
It's a good app for school but you can forget the ID or pass code and the teacher can lock the meeting while you are not in the meeting
Not works on my laptop so I am faceing some issuesÃ°Å¸ËœÅ¾. After the update it doesn't work on my laptopÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¥. Its very annoying
I don't have a option of virtual image in my Android phone and in most of the phones u will not find that
buttons are so small. rate of misclicking is like 100% which is extremely annoying! once misclick button disappears. extremely poor UX
It's a nice way to communicate and had meeting issue is time limit !!! Hope time limit can be resolved
This is a good app but there is a problem that the meetings cannot be more than 40 minutes. As the meeting ends in 40 minutes then some time our doughts remains
Its almost 9 months that I am using Zoom as I am a teacher.. From 2 months I guess I am having problem.. On my mobile phone,share option is not coming.. Its very difficult for a teacher if share option is disabled. Kindly look after my problem asap..
There should be an option that we can pin other participant's video from the participants tab. Because, It's very hard to find my teacher when all students turn there Mic on and get switched to the screen instead of the teacher. Add this option please.
Very useful app to talk to friends without using call dial but also useful for online class 3 stars because of a bug/glitch which shows that in participation its showing video is off please fix that I will give u a five star rating Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â
I can't hear the other participants speaking and I don't know why it isn't working please be able to find ways so people can easily find how to hear the audio of the other participants
"My connection is good but it shows that ""there is a problem and the error code is abc"".Now I can't join my any school meeting that is very important for me."
It can not reacord the Audio in any app and it off video when we go to participants
The only problem is if you have a option of virtual background in android mobile like vivo
Everything is fine but the only thing ihate most is that it automatically changes to landsape and portrait even if auto rotateis off plz fix it ....it is extremely frustrating
I have a good network connection but it keeps removing me in-and-out during my classes, it disturbs a lot, Not a very nice app only few good features
Unable to use zoom via Android auto however Apple car play does seem to support to support zoom app. Other than that the app works fine.
Not bad. But this app has to improve it network coverage . So that we can use it in 2G network also.
Really hate the fact that I can't important my Good Calendar zoom invites into the app itself, even though it integrates with my Google account.
Best app for online class only we can't unmute ourselves and can't do screen sharing Ã°Å¸Â¤Â£Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­. LOL But it has a problem that it's showing incorrect password and also sometimes it's showing internet connection and giving two options ok , report Then I can't do anything and my phone and father phone I connect with same internet but in my father phone it's working so I think some mobile the zoom is showing so please fix this problem as soon as possible that's why I gave 3 stars Thank you
Sometimes just gets stuck & doesn't respond
I can't use my Android phone to share videos as the hoster if I try to share I got feed back saying unable to Display video.
It does not have a virtual background.
It's a very nice app and easy to use ... But sometimes there is audio and video quality is low.
Thanks to a certain person mishandling the pandemic apps like this are necessary. It does work okay and we are able to meet people online and help get through these lousy times.
It is very worst app because when I on my in participants it is showing off from update sovle this proplem early as possible.Only for this app is weak.
Zoom need to continually monitor and update to ensure the millions get smooth connections. Will improve my stars as Zoom improve.
This is a Big Problem for me After This update. When I start My video. I can see it but no one else on the meeting can see my video. Even I see That It is shown That My video is of on the participants. Please Fix This Problem.
Wanted sign in through audio only but couldn't find out how.
Can you provide notifications every time a user's audio and video was mute/unmuted. It would really help since we could track and be aware if we are on mute or not.
So it was all pretty good until lately that I've started having this problem were anytime I turn on the camera, the audio of the call starts sounding robotic and it cuts off, as if I was connected to a very bad WiFi signal, but it's not the WiFi because my signal is fine. Please if you could reach out to me and solve this it would be great because I need the camera for my university classes, it's a requirement to have it on to prove your assistance
In the past 3 week i can not get in it with my church meetings 2 a week and we are getting ready or bell ringing and it is troubling that I can't get into with the meeting I cannot see their faces that goes in and out on the speaker is aggravating me please try to help me fix this problem
Sometimes it can stucks,connection problems there just see once, it is not full Time of clarity or HD
The User Interface is not so good (I think). There should be a dark theme in UI.
I am facing so many problems in this app.I am unable to join online class due to some technical problem in this. this is a waste app I have ever seen
I think there is an option to disconnect or hide the video it cause problem like foor students if camera on by mistake ..... Please add this feature also
Design not well organized. More intuition or obviousness needs to be incorporated in to this product.
You go to the home screen kicks you out dosent work most of the time laggy and low freedom I cant change a lot of things.
After updating also my save option in annotation is not coming and in screen share screen audio options is also not coming.
I gave it 3 stars because so many faults are there to be seen.Sometimes it will tell incorrect pass code. Sometimes,we can't admit people and sometimes,we can't hear anyone with also our strong Internet.Please fix all these problems.Thanku!
It is not working in my tablet lenovo M10.
It was working best but now a bit problem in voices. I can hear but others can not hear me please fix it up .
Very thinks is good but there are problems of internal audio is not record, tell me my sir taking lecture and i wanted to record then how can I record my sir screen with internal audio, please give permission to record internal audio because this is very Big difficulty to students please is a kind request
It is ok but sometimes it creates a lot of problem i have reinstall this app more than four times but it also works good i am happy with this app because everything have some positive point and some negative Thanks
There should be an option to create breakout room via mobile. Also time does not reflect in chat via mobile.
Very good app but there in safe driving mode you can add that how many minutes are remaining to end the meeting
It some bug whenever the calls come in between the meetings it gets disconnected so its annoying
When i on my cam and view participate list it shows my camera off untill iam unmuted in case of this i have being putted in waiting room.
Lately i m facing a problem with the feature of the app ; the video .I already turned it on but it shows off in the participants list. My colleagues and teachers couldn't see my camera icon on in participants list . But the video will be seen on in gallery view. I have reinstalled the app but the problem has not yet fixed . So its a request to fix the prblm as early as possible Ã°Å¸â„¢â€¡Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â„¢â‚¬Ã¯Â¸Â As i m facing difficulty while attending online lectures
Video resolution and cearity is not good. There should be an option to use phone camera.
Its is a good appÃ°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬ but sometimes I can't join any meetingÃ°Å¸â„¢Â. Pls improve it a bit more. But rest everything is good.Ã¢Â­Â
Even when your video is turned on, if go to participants or chat it shows that your video is turned off. Pls diable this update as soon as possible.i hate it. Iam giving 3 Ã¢Â­Â Ã¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­Â only bcz of this.
It's a good app . Whenever many people add in the group it will not work as much as previous . Work on it .
The app is great but there is a bug so ye pl fix that bug or glitch
They should add a skip button cuz it's too boring.... Also eats away my net data and my battery, why is it so battery consuming?
My video in the participant list is always showing off. This is also happening to everyone even for my child's online classes. Please Zoom I request you to solve this problem. This problem started after the new zoom update. Please I request to solve this problem.
Update again for bringing some effects in Android too pls fix this. Pls. Understand my problem and pls fix my problem. I need zoom effects like cat,dog, and some filters
This app is good but not that much. It is running properly before the latest update but when I updated it to the latest version It stops representing the camera on. I think this is a bug in this app. I request the manufacturers to fix this bug in the next update. And the voice quality is also not that much good after network is good or bad. It doesn't matter, the voice starts buffering. So kindly fix all my issues related to this app. This app is nice for meetings if we forget these issues.
"Nice app, but some times there are bugs or something, cause sometimes I get randomly disconnected, though the host did not. And I would also like to add that, sometimes it is not possible to join an important class because, it shows that "" The meeting is in progress"" or "" The host did not start the meeting"" even though she did. And I am sometimes not able to join a meeting because of this weird reason were i gave the right PMI and Password but it would not let me join. Pls fix these problems!"
"I can not find menu ""virtual background""? It can not be changed the background."
I am giving three stars to this because i have allowed zoom settings to call over internet but i have to connect my audio. its annoying
The virtual background for Android is not working even after fulfilling all the requirements.
However I am facing frequent disconnection problems for the past few days. I have checked there are other activites that continue without interruption, but zoom takes a long time to connect, and then disconnects every 5 minutes. I suspect the culprit is the latest update.
The app is good and easy but I don't seem to hear either with headset or hand free from my phone.
Cannot even use this app in background. I cannot see any video I have to rejoin the meeting.
The Experience of the app isn't as good as the desktop version. One thing which is terrible, is the lack in video setting options. If you wear black, zoom automatically brightens the face to compensate for the black, making the face over exposed and bright yellow, which doesn't happen on other platforms. Can't even think of adding a ring light. I haven't noticed this on the desktop version.
I don't know about the screen sharing in the zoom app so if you keep any guide in the zoom we can understand the features in the zoom please find answer for the problem thank you
Business or school: It is just right for video conferences, meetings, school- related meetings, & etc. Socially: It is a nice way to connect but also interact with other people. my only dislike is, it uses a lot of data, once data runs out, it runs very slow affecting the quality of the meetings. But that may not be an app issue, but instead internet connection issues.
Not too much Good..Too Much Connection Problems...And Not able to listen properly what the host Is Saying.Very Bad... But pls remove Disconnection in it
Sometimes meeting cannot be accessed
Not bad i guess.It is the only app i use for onlline class but one problem the voices always cut and sometimes we disconnected
Could only view people 4 to view on smartphones and tablets. Would like to be able to call someone into a meeting without sending a linked invitation.
Thing is that when I am joining a meeting it is connecting but after that it shows Back to meeting and for a long time I can't see anything. The screen is full blank. and when the meeting is going on if I go to Participants there it is showing my video off. My teacher thought that I am keeping my video off and she throw me out of class. Very sad for this thing.Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€
I Have An Issue Whenever I Join A Meeting, It Shows Call Over Internet, Instead Of The Microphone And I Cant Hear Anything
This app is Ok But. . . there's problems. 1. It takes ages to get on to meetings and I wish it would take less time as I want to be able to get on to my meetings and 2.It is sooo-hard to login! But it doesn't have much adds and that's a good thing Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€° I also think it should be easier to get on to meetings and sometimes I wait like 5 mins and then it tells me it's not working Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€™Ã°Å¸â„¢â€ž. Like OMG people just wanna have a call!
Don't make passcode system, only make link or meeting id system so that only host can allow the participants and they won't face any problem in joining the meet.
It took me a while to figure out all the settings to this app. Though, I consider it a must need app. Many businesses etc. have suggested it & use it also. To bypass transportation barriers or inability to be a part of an important meeting in court, school, counseling/ teaching/learning opportunities for any type of organization, school, or team. Very convenient for this COVID Pandemic around the world at this time. Seems to have been invented at the right time and for the right reasons.
First it as a minor bugs like when I went to recent page it bugs as my pic stuckes and I cheat my Mam but I couldn't do now
I love this but some times i cant connect to the class i reported rhe problems too mainy times wirh another phone number but my problem never solve Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¢Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¢ but nice app
Zoom is a pretty cool app...however I give it a 3 because I expected to see the other person during my meeting, not just myself...thumbs down at that particular aspect. However, with Covid going on, it does make some meetings much easier to attend.
The Zoom app always appear on my cellphone. I want the icon to appear and be downloaded on my Dell desktop-JL36U07.
Very old UI & UX, please improve it make something modern looking and add white colour to the primary meeting ui.
It not connecting properly. always reconnecting.
I am really unhappy with the experience with the new zoom update. Since i have updated it the voice is always breaking and the video is not clear, because of this problem I can't attend my online classes properly. Before this update was here i was happy it but now its horrible.
It's good but sometimes it does not works and shows that the host may be blocked you or internet problem
I often have trouble with either the sound or the video synchronizing.
So I think it's fine overall but there is one major issue with the mobile app that is baffling me it won't get addressed. You can't go back to chat outside of a meeting when you're in a zoom meeting in the app. That's just obsurd. Think about it. If you use zoom the way they market it and adopt chat then you basically can't use chat when you are in a zoom meeting so what's the point. Still hasn't been addressed and we are nine months I to Covid. Terrible.
Good app for students... Video sharing is so so.. But audio is good in this. Overall good.
I would give it three stars only because since the last update I am facing a problem that, 'If my camera is on than also in the participants it is showing that my camera or video is of. Due to this I have been removed form the meeting a high number of times and I want a option to pin two videos at the same time.
this app is great and all but... the limited number of android phones that can use virtual backgrounds hinders me from giving this a 5 star. (my phone is part of the many that don't have the virtual background option, and i am very disappointed in that. i get that it may be due to performance issues or something of the like, but i don't suppose you guys can restrict a tiny bit of the virtual background section but also make it available for all android users?)
The new update of zoom app has some issue if I have call over net automatically but it is not auto connect please fix this issue
Overall! This app runs good but the video quality is not at the highest level!....
I dont have Ã°ÂÂÂ¯Ã°ÂÂÂ¢Ã°ÂÂÂ«Ã°ÂÂÂ­Ã°ÂÂÂ®Ã°ÂÂÅ¡Ã°ÂÂÂ¥ Ã°ÂÂâ€ºÃ°ÂÂÅ¡Ã°ÂÂÅ“Ã°ÂÂÂ¤Ã°ÂÂÂ Ã°ÂÂÂ«Ã°ÂÂÂ¨Ã°ÂÂÂ®Ã°ÂÂÂ§Ã°ÂÂÂ option even after updating,but it is weldone app for online classes,friends meet.and i have sometimes problem it was showing Ã°ÂÂÅ“Ã°ÂÂÂ¨Ã°ÂÂÂ§Ã°ÂÂÂ§Ã°ÂÂÅ¾Ã°ÂÂÅ“Ã°ÂÂÂ­Ã°ÂÂÂ¢Ã°ÂÂÂ§Ã°ÂÂÂ  while in a meet.Ã°Å¸ËœÅ¸
It is not working on mobile.
well i was gonna give this app 5 stars but there is one thing that i don't liked about this app is when i am using zoom app on laptop i am not able to switch on dark mode even when i watched youtubes videos they are just showing that we can switch it on by going to gerenal but according to the new updates it's not possible and most of the peoples are facing this ..while when i download zoom app on my phone i am able to switch on dark mode but not in my laptop...which stress my eyes a lot
My main issue with any facet of zoom service has always been poor user workflows. For example, the trying to leave a meeting when using the app if you are anywhere other than the main participant view is non-intuitive. Similarly, there does not appear to be a way to switch the audio to a normal headset/phone mode in the app, and dialing in to a meeting in progress is frustrating.
When i want to record video by the screen recorder app zoom don't allow to record sound.. but why? its unfair
Excellent application. They should have a free light version for family meets & fraternity gatherings.
I have been using the app from April with no problem at all. But with the recent update Zoom is showing glitches. It is draining too much internet and even though my video is on in the participants it is not showing. It is also having noise suppression problem. Can please fix it because it is becoming difficult for me to do school classes. The in-built report problem system is not functioning properly because there is no response from you guys.
I am facing issues regarding the video . Even if my video is on , the symbol in the participant list shows its off . I even uninstalled and reinstalled but there was no avail.
Its great! But I can't apply a background without a green one. And i can't apply background in phone. Sometimes when a call comes and when I decline it the voice becomes so low I can barely hear it, but only sometimes. Otherwise, good to goÃ°Å¸ËœÅ Ã°Å¸ËœÅ . The devlopers please look. And now after I have updated this app, in every meeting the host says, why is your video off, even though its on, in the participants list it shows its off, please look into this
I only gaved 3 star because of 2 reasons :- 1) The video quality is bad , our body shape gets disturb and if our face is oval so it becomes round and if it is round then it becomes oval. Sometimes anyone cannot recognise me because if my face shape . 2) I can never delete my profile photo . the option for deleting my profile photo never comes instead I had updated zoom . Instead of these 2 things, all things are perfect .Ã°Å¸ËœÂ
Whenever I unmute myself, I couldn't hear the other participants' audio when we are speaking simultaneously. What seems to be the problem? Is it my phone or the app's malfunction? I hope this problem would be fixed asap. Zoom is a great app and can be considered essential now for the meetings we have, adapting to the new normal situation during the pandemic.
It does what it says, the UI is still messy though with options here there and everywhere in or out of meetings. One thing I should add; the app description says virtual background has been added. This is true, up to a point - two handsets here, same app version installed on both, and it's available on one but not the other. Whether the difference is the chipset (one handset has SD, the other does not) or something else though who knows, hopefully future updates will tell us.
All of a sudden my video feed shows up REALLY dark - other participants can barely see me! It must be just Zoom. I've tried looking in settings to adjust brightness (or to see if a filter is in affect), but can't find anything for it.
Good app but I takes a lot of network and get disconnected by poor net connection....
Zoom is, kind of a mixed bag. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I wish it was a bit more colourful and interactible though, as it feels extremely bland and empty. Since we have to use zoom a lot these days.
Ok ok app... Gets disconnected often but one thing is that it connects itself and not like Google Meet that we will have to enter the code again and blah blah blah....but please look before you leap... So, pretty good app better than Google meet. I have edited this after 6-7 months of experience, in my first review l told that it was a very bad app, but it turned out to be a good app and also, it is FAKE that it's security is not reliable, but after using it for 6-7 months even, it had NO issue.
When I lower my hand in the meeting, the hand lowers but the raise hand sign (Ã°Å¸â€“Â) still remains on my screen. That is a little annoying.
"I have to coach almost all my clients on how to enable audio and video... why do they have to click so many buttons to join audio. They don't know what ""internet audio"" means so it's confusing to even young people and a pain to deal with for every client I have to teach. Zoom nailed everything except this... and It's a video call for goodness sakes! Please change ""internet audio"" to ""click here for sound,"" if it's too much to ask for an auto connect option."
It has a disgusting promblem that the camera closes when you open participant list or chat box Please fix it
I used this app as an online classes for my school. Bt since yesterday the app is being updated due to which whenever I go to the participants list or to any other web page my video automatically turns off. And due to which whenever we have exams on Google forms automatically the video gets turned off. And it is becoming a serious issue. Hope u will try the best to make some changes. Thank you
Hello guys, I like app but I can give only 3 stars because 1. THERE IS NO OPTION TO REMOVE PROFILE PICTURE 2. IF SOMEONE STARTS THEIR VIDEO IT IS NOT IN FULL SCREEN MODE 3. THERE IS NO HELP AND SUPPORT 4. EVEN IF I SEND IT TO MAIL THEY ARE NOT RESPONDING(# Please type your reply above this line #)(They are saying like this). I guess you will see this. We need new updates with these things
Okay.. This app is great.. I have used it for at least 1000 meetings.. But... I'm using a dell laptop the latest laptop... And now after the latest update I can't see the virtual background option! Before the update it was available and it worked well.. Now I am really upset because I'm 13 and I love changing my background! Something I like a lot! Please help me out! I love this app I don't want to delete it for a small reason! -Evangeline (sincere user of zoom!)Ã¢ËœÂº
Before it was updated, it used less data but now it uses alot of internet. Whenever you go to the participants list or other apps, the video reflects as off which is annoying. Sometimes the meeting gets disconnected and shows connecting even when the data speed is high. Make updates which use less data and video does not switch off while using other apps.
The problem is that if a participant has less data, he faces a lot of troubles.. moreover, it doesn't gets connected.. secondly, when I host a meeting in my PC, I change the settings to allow multiple participants to share the screen at a time.. but it never occurs.. only single participant can share the screen.. in PC, i can never share my screen of the zoom meeting.. whereas I can share it in a mobile..
Its video quality is good
It is a nice app dont get me wrong the thing is that there are some minor connection glitches and bugs
Great app but but needs to improve alot ot get in to the giants line that is google meet and ms teams.
I am not able to see my preview on the cloud meeting. The image appears dark and cannot make out the features. The audio was also muted completely and upon reinstalling and installing the app twice and opening the application, the video preview is still very dark.
It is very good app for online classes and for VIDEO CALLS IT IS VERY MUCH BETTER THAN WHATSAPP VIDEO CALLS it sometimes make very irritating but it's okay
I usually use this Zoom while having class meetings or gathering with my friends, but there is one problem and that is important, the microphone function in this app is not function, despite myself try to turn on/off microphone on my phone or try headphones/earphones just so I can try to use microphone on the meeting. I hope this is fixed ASAP. Thanks
This app is good but one Problem is it glitches a lot in mobile. But when I use it on my pc or laptop it works just fine. But I would hope a few more features. 1. Please try to solve the bugs in the app 2. And please make it up to 100 not only 100
Sometimes it makes me angryÃ°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ  because disconection , when my video is on in meeting but it shows my video is off in participant's list........... This problem should be fixed.
It is good but recently after the new update I am having a problem that when I am switching to another app while a zoom meeting, my video is turning off, which was not happening earlier, earlier the video froze when you switched to another app. This is causing a problem during my online exams. I hope you will look into the matter and do something.
It is a bit frustrating that after waiting in the lobby for the host to connect.
I can't you choose to see more occupants than just 4 in gallery view. Such a silly omission.
Very best app for online studies but there is a trouble that the outsiders come easily in the meeting and disturb all the students which causes a great disturbance in the minds and concentration of students. There should be a feature of writing a list of students and the app will automatically accept them to enter and those whose name is not in the list they will be put into the waiting room then the host will decide whether to join or reject them . This feature will be very very useful for us .
Why all the benefits to laptop users. They are enable to record meeting also they can see almost everyone in the grid view also they can also use virtual backgrounds and effects. But we cell phone users do not have this feature.
This is a nice app. But here is time issue. After 45 minutes its closes meeting which is so irritating. On the other hand google meet has no time issue. So i suggest everyone if you need unlimited meeting time then u should use google meet. Unfortunately we all need unlimited meeting time. But so far i know google meet doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t support record option. If you need record the meeting and 45 minutes is enough for your meeting then you should use zoom meeting.
It lacks to connect audio automatically.
It continually cuts out and drops the Zoom meeting. It was frustrating!!
At the start of lockdown it was completely fine however when we went into summer it was draining our battery and making our devices hot. It kept on freezing and going echoey. There was once where it wouldn't let me in for a hour even though I had good WiFi. Lately it has been echoey and cutting out but I am not sure whether that is my WiFi or the app. Overall, it is a great app because when my groups can't meet for meetings we go on zoom and it works quite well for what we want to do.
App is good but need changes: 1. Transparent gesture navigation bar; 2. Fix root user dark mode attention card; 3. Make notification bar color adaptive for make app full screen directly without this or navigation; 4. Little smooth animations on switching layout's make experience better; 5. Adaptive icon. Thanks and have a great day! Ã¢Å“Å’Ã¯Â¸Â
Zoom app is not as good as you want is get diconnect in each meetings.
Its a great app for my online school but after the last 3 updates, i did zoom on my phone and my audio was just broken. Every persons voice was a robot. This occurred after a zoom update. All my other apps that require audios and microphones are all good. Please fix this issue. I don't get disconnected or anything. Its a great app for my online school
The zoom app is very good. But eventhought i switched on my video but in participant list it shows that i switched off my video. Please make sure that it must not repeat again. It doesnt happen to me alone it happens to many members. So make that and sometimes it automatically disconnects eventhought i have clear network. And it comes out of the meeting while some important information is going on. Make sure not to repeat again but otherwise the app is very good. One of the best app
It's good , but provide mute and video on/off features in the notification panel..
It is nice app but while we do screen mirroring to a TV it doesn't gives us sound Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¢Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¢
This app is nice, wonderful. I use this app for school lecture. Bt one day what happened I don't know I'm did on my camera and in video box I could see my face but in participants box my video was off.beacuse of that teacher punished me bt there is no my mistake. Zoom plzz do something....!!!!!!!!!
App is good but is missing some of the functionality that you get if you use zoom on an iPad or iPhone
Great sound great picture but some options that were lost with updates would nice to be an option again, but stay as a choice not automatic, like not allowing more that one person to open as host, no host keys and if you accidentally or on purpose you boot someone it should be reversible right away not 24hrs later. These things should still be options as meetings are different, and large, people are needed so things can functions at peak efficiency and some still need them for daily running.
The new update is really not helping . The working of the video mode has a bug for sure ,whenever I turn on my video ,in the participant list it shows off and because of that I have also been scolded during my exam even though my video was on all the time . Please fix this bug Am uninstalling it and installing it again cause I have no other option since I have to give my exam on this.
It was good until update in early Aug 2020 (using Android 5.1 on a PEGI3 tablet). Then video often freezes (even my own image) when showing more than one mugshot. I'm using it mainly for socially distanced music and have kept with it because the audio is acceptable but not wonderful. Please make available: turn off automatic mic. volume & disable ALL audio processing (not just allow 'original sound'); more than 4 mugshots at a time (bigger tablets would easily show 9).
The front camera provides very dark video during the video calls. The back camera works pretty well but it is of no use during video calls. This issue is not related to lighting or camera quality of the phone as the photos and videos are very bright while using the camera outside of the application. I believe there is some issue while using the front camera of this device in the App.
Still has lots of bugs. I want to bring here is as soon as you connect your mobile with a bluetooth headset/speaker the meeting starts freezing. Only thing we can do is disconnect the device.
Like the abilities the app offers and its honestly saved my life as I use it to communicate with my 10yr old who has been quarantined without family due to COVID-19. Unfortunately the app resets often and freezes more now that schools back on-presumably because of the access amount of users but other than that I think the addition of the break out rooms and private messaging available is pretty cool as well
Pls make more sticker and function I like some sticker so pls add some more sticker my experiences is good but some time meeting is say that my video is off but is it not off the video of mine is still open there are many glitches in the app
This was a very good app but it started working very bad. I'm always facing a problem with this during my online classes i.e. whenever I turn on my video and go to participants list and check it is showing that I turned off my video and they are unable to see my video. I hope zoom will find a solution for this with next update or mail me what to do.
This application is better than others application, but there are some technical issues I had found... The most important thing is password and zoom meeting i'd,, if there are a save option of meeting i'd & password, I think it will helpful for everyone.. Because, if I leave the meeting, nd again I trying to join the meeting then, I must give meeting i'd & password hereÃ°Å¸ËœÅ’ which one's I personally dislike..! Thank YouÃ¢ÂÂ¤
My first experience with zoom was a bit of a challenge for the connection was not totally great, I am pretty sure this was on my end not zooms fault for II have sorry connection in my area with sorry cell phone service.
Instead of zoom kicking you out for lack of a strong data connection can it just reload and continue. The multiple boots out then back in are inconvinient.
Easy to use. Can set up meeting easily. Only issues I have are with it freezing or not hearing anything when I am on my meetings. It might be my signal or tablet. Either way it affects my experience with my clients.
I have been using ZOOM for about two months now. Not seeing many of the problems others are having. Next update please please give us option to show more participants (up to 16 would be great) on our smartphone / tablet screens. Even if resolution is less it would be a big improvement... The current limit of 4 (even if we can scroll through multiple participants screens) takes this app down bigtime. If we get this, ZOOM can be a strong 4 going on 5 app!
Zoom is a good chat room simulator but, if you have bad internet connection, you will have a very bad time with zoom. I am not 100% sure how zoom host room on internet, but it still a good program at the end of the day.
It is a amazing app! But, there is a problem that ,I can't see my profile picture. But, I have set my profile picture.Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥ A..... For this problem sometime I hate this and sometime I like this for its other features!Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€°.(I think it is the best zoom app, and you can download it!!Ã°Å¸â„¢â€šÃ°Å¸Â¤â€œ.
This app is great for school purposes meetings but still virtual background isn't available in my mobile phone.
i'm a student who uses this meeting app for online school. in my opinion it runs well and nice, but when i switched to wifi i couldn't get in any meeting but when i change to mobile data it runs smoothly.
"Useful but eats data more than reasonable. Not sure how ""clean"" it actually is with that much data usage !!! We are all suddenly using this, even though we have grown with other video calling apps. Sheepish behavior."
There are some moments when there is a lot of connectivity problems due to which I miss important points of lecture Therefore I advice the zoom inc. to reduce connectivity problem and if there is connectivity problem then only loose the connection of the host . This way the students will not miss their lecture.
It's good for meetings and personal appointments so you can still keep in contact with your friends and family and appointments it also helps keep people safe
Well it took me months to get my zoom to work but now here's my new problem I can't update it's saying that it cannot download cloud meetings, so here we go again I thought we moved away from computers because we had this terrible trouble that every time we tried to install program by Microsoft including word, that you couldn't do it you couldn't fix the problem to this day I still see word with problems that I saw in the 90s. So what's the problem what do we got to do to get a app to work.
Hey there team, Since last few sessions I'm having problem using video option, while keeping on my video in meeting/class, its not visible to other members and host, but on my side It looks all fine. Please help me with it.
Good app but how come I enable my video but on the Participants panel it says that I have not enabled! I almost got removed from a meeting. The past versions were better than this one. I would have given it 5 stars if it was not for this. Please fix it.
I would say it's a good app but some things are not up to the mark and too much bugs, sometime it is impossible to use the app. And I would like to see some new features like virtual background like the web version of zoom. So think about it. And one more thing after each update it feels like they have removed previous bugs and added some more to fix later which is very annoying.
hi, after 3.4.0 update I can't annotate the right part of the screen when I'm sharing my screen on my Samsung Tab S7 Dex Mode. This doesn't happen on tablet mode but I use Dex Mode when I'm working. This issue didn't exist in version 3.3.5 so I downgraded my zoom to version 3.3.5 because I need to use the annotaion. Also If u realize that we don't have eraser tool in annotation tool when we're shaing our screen. Please consider to fix the issues. Thanks.
This is good and all But yes I have a lot of complaints for it.1 It takes a LOT of time to open up like I try to login 5 mins earlier into my class and instead it takes SO much time to open up and login that I get in the class atleast 10 mins late! Is this a joke or what?! 2 Whenever I try to share my screen the app closes within 30 secs of my screen share. Like why?? 3 Whenever I open any other app (like chrome) while in a meeting, I get disconnected from the meeting. I am facing a lot of prob
It is a nice app. But suddenly in the middle of the meeting it gets disconnect and after few seconds it again gets connected. I think there should be some more improvement in this application. Sometimes it takes time to join the meeting.
I don't blame it for the problems because of internet connection...but it should have some kind of pop up for the person who is having connection problem other than the WiFi logo at the corner... because only few notice it, at least the blame won't be passed on to others!
I like the UI from Windows where you can see 25 users at once. If you're casting Zoom from android to your TV that UI comes in handy even though not 25 but 9 screens could be possible I believe. Kindly add that toggle or switch. The app is good other than that we dont get many settings which are already present in the Windows version of the app.
Please update your app because when I turn on my video then the partipant chart shows my video is off. So reply me how to fix it ?
The video and the music are not always coordinated. The video will slow down. Same for the music but not necessarily at the same time as the video. Sometimes it was so bad that I left the class early. The sound quality of the music was generally poor.
Sometimes the meeting lapses in between and restarts by itself. Unable to use Voice typing in chat while meeting is going on. Even reported the issue from within the app but no response has been received so far. If the two issues can be resolved, it would be an even better experience.
I give it 3Ã¢Â­Â because I really don't want any kind of update to this app this is really a good one but Recently zoom updated and now in the app - if your zoom video camera is ON , still it shows that your zoom video camera is OFF when you move to participants just like this if you switch to recent tasks apps then again it doesn't pause your video it shows OFF . Please remove this feature as soon as possible . It's not suitable for this app at all. Thanks Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
Plz kindly remove the feature of auto turn off of the video. All the remaining features are super cool. It is also very helpful in this lockdown situation. Plz make the setting of camera manual not automatic . Make it as it used to be before the updatewhich was super cool.Kindly consider my suggestion
Audio doesn't work.
It was good but recently after new updates I am having a problem that my vedio is on in gallery view but when I checked in participants list its showing that my vedio is off. If I also turned my vedio on but then also its showing off in the participants lists. This new update has made me quite irritiating and also I am facing problem due to it in my online exams. I also tried to reinstall it by uninstalling it several times. Please check this problem.
It is a very good technology to teach the students in the pandemic like Covid-19.But I have an complaints:- 1.It always gets disconnected when we open any background. 2.Sometimes the voice gets very terrible. 3.Sometimes the video gets blurr and disconnects automatically.lil girl is fool
When the meeting started I will myself mute my mike and turn on my video. But when I go to participants and checked for myself, the video symbol was in off. It is very uncomfortable.
This app is soo good,but I hope you will update this as we like,and some users of these zoom are also facing same problem, we are waiting for good zoom app
"Zoom is certainly a handy app to have in these days, necessary even as so many ""meetings"" can only be ""attended"" now online. The reason for my low rating is the overly prevalent ""Zoom Freeze"" which has affected EVERY meeting I have been involved in on Zoom, where the person speaking freezes the screen and whatever they say is lost."
Often gets disconnected during meeting. Freezing even in high internet connection.
The app is a weird one,only on my Chemistry classes the app's performance goes below average for all attendees and causes a lot of trouble,no matter when the class is held, this happens irrespective of the internet connection of the host.
I have to face lots of problem in a meeting. Earlier When I press home button the video would pause but now when I press home button the video would turn off. When we open participant list then also video turns off. This update is not fruitful for us. This update brings lot of problem for us .
Nice app. But it must have an option to record meetings in phones too.
This app don't functioned well, but my friends use this and think it's perfect! Just, check your internet connection, because for me it's a principal problem..
Good app but I need a feature where I can temporarily turn on the mic by pressing and holding the call button on my headphone, pls make that available!
Please check out the problem , that I am having... I am a student and hence I need zoom alot during this situation.. My internet connection is too good. However zoom doesn't gives effective quality of video during online class. Many a times , the video glitches , the audio becomes unaudible. The main issue is the quality of video.. Having a good internet connection but still can't see the picture is very miserable!
It is building better than its other competitors, but the issue I am facing is that you cannot delete a message from the chat if you accidentally typed something. The meeting gets disconnected if meanwhile you have opened some other application in the background (in android).
There are some problems like when ever a phone call came and i reject it or accept it and tell to call me later and reject it It's voice is gone to call speaker and i have to turn off the bluethoot and then turn on again and then it will come to my headphone And also my net will get over and i am not be able to use internet for me It is taking a lot of net And it will ask to sign in again and again.
Actually a good app but needs virtual background and background filters for android version already there is for iPhone version too add for android There's a problem when I swipe to look for people in zoom it lags, my device doesn't have no lags or no problem device is fine But the app itself lags and when I try to turn on or off app delays And my camera seems to get stucked App has lot of delays Maybe bugs or glitches Please fix this
"Great on Windows 10 & iOS Devices but PLEASE make the android version more like iOS or better yet like Windows! I use a Samsung tab s7+ and get the same app as an android phone, This makes it difficult to host meetings since I cannot view the spotlight person and ""participants"" window @ the same time. Huge downfall here, please optimize for android tablets."
It is very good for online meeting but during meeting when I am writing any message so my video is automatically off and when I am opening any other app like gallery for seeing any questions which I have to ask my video is automatically off , so I suggest please update any new system like this. In other ways this app is best but please see this problem. Thank you.
Very bad app. video keeps pausing..sometimes sound doesn't come fully and sometimes my sound doesn't reach to others ....if it reaches then it goes with many breaks that others can't listen properly... meetings also gets disconnected many times and takes too long to get connected... And also sometimes if my video is on then it shows it off to others ... either with profile pic or with blank black screen ..if it shows the video then with many pauses.
I don't feel like I have much of a choice in which virtual meeting software I use. Nearly everyone I meet with uses zoom (except my not so tech savvy parents). I have no other experience with which I can accurately compare and judge my zoom experience. So, it's good. I guess.
Best app of 2020 for all But there is a problem If your video is on and u go in participants your video will automatically turned off At the end best Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â
Not so good because; 1-Meeting time limit is boring. It must be unlimited or depends to host. 2-Meeting settings must be better. Like personel id must take priority. Everytime creating meeting, id changes. 3-Voice and display quality must be better. 1 and 2 reduces 1 star and 3 reduces 1 star. User limit and visuality are good.
After some days it started giving some problems.....and it was difficult to join any meeting
Please add pc settings. When I speak normally my friends can't hear me. Even I have a good internet connection. There should be option of volume of mic when you say something.
It's recent update is causing problem whenever we chat, use another app, open participant list, etc during meeting Video automatically turns off, it's causing difficulty in attending zoom class because my exams occur during meeting and I have to open google forms to give exam, and my video gets swich off, previously it gets freeze so teacher did not scold, but now teacher scolds because video gets turned off.
The replay is ONLY of people that talked alot. Quiet friends and relatives on video aren't seen in replay I'm saddened by that b/c there were up to 35 people on & only a few are in the replay.
Showing video off in participate. A major issue please solve this very annoying
This app is very good. But it has a problem when ever i try to share screen the class gets disconnected. Please resolve this problem as soon as possible. My class gets disturbed .
It is good but my voice is not hearing them. And their voice was breaking from 2 month. My network is also full but there also this problem. I had feedback so many times but no any responses. When any one call me then my and teachers voice is clear. They always ask me what is your problem? What can I say for that ?
My experience was quite good but one thing which I felt about it was the meeting didn't connect with the vodafone network. Kindly resolve this thing please as I am a vodafone user and it creates a big issue for me.
Please fix the problem of rotating of the screen . Whenever I put down the phone the screen gets automatically rotated and the screen gets touch and my video gets on .Please add an option to manually rotate the screen instead of doing automatically . Hope you will understand the issue and take necessary steps .Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¶Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¶
This is a Good and simple app. I Like this app. But sometimes there are problems such as disconnecting to audio, and many other. This app is helpful for meÃ°Å¸ËœÆ’. Zoom is a helpful app for meeting.Ã°Å¸ËœÅ Ã¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸Â Thanks.
The minimum volume is still too loud. If there is more range to the volume because I have sensitive hearing and I have a hard time getting it to a comfortable level. Also, the audio cuts off when I go to the chat box.
1 problem is that when we left the app while meeting is going on so our video get off this should not happen please do something about it this not happen before but now this is happening..
This app was working fantastic before I updated it..... After updating this app had many nice programs...... Now here comes the problem, Ã°Å¸â€˜â€¡Ã°Å¸â€˜â€¡Ã°Å¸â€˜â€¡Ã°Å¸â€˜â€¡ When u return to home screen your video automatically turns off and whenever you go to participants list...... Plz solve this problem ASAP.... If you solve this problem I am going to give this app 5 star.... Thank u... Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Some times strucking and when attempting calls if it is connected to bluetooth getting disconnected, its very frustrating
All other things are ok but the problem is that I am not able to sign up to my account tried tooo many times but it tells( it is not the correct time to sign-up).. and there is also networks problem in the App ...... if you correct the problem i will surely rate it 5 Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸
"I gave only 3 stars because when my teacher sends the zoom link, when I try to enter it, 2 or 3 minutes after..they shows that ""Cannot connect to our service.please check your internet connection. Then, they wil show an error code. This zoom app takes too much of network during the meeting....."
It's mic does not work when we connect any bluetooth headphone or any thing so i am unable to attend my classes properly i request you to fix this problem
I have a issue that issue is that when we are in meeting when if we switch to other app video will turn off immediately and when we go to participants list video will turn off please I request you to solve this problem many people have this issue so please solve this problem.
First of all it's a great app. we could share files and videos despite of the big size of each files. But the thing is since I've change my picture it happens to be blur Ã°Å¸ËœÅ’ and I don't know why it happen. My account is connected to my Gmail. Hope you'll take an action to this thanks!
I have my classes at zoom first it was good for my classes but now when I'm joining the link it doesn't show that I have joined and again I have to leave it and one more thing when I'm doing class it is showing in between the report problem and i can't join that link hoe many times I try please fix the problems.
I had tried multiple times and was just showing connecting while I wasn't visible to the host and the mute button wasn't functional that led to my audio not working.
Initially it was SPECTACULAR for clarity, but the upgrade that occurred about 6 weeks ago was horrible. I had been zooming with my tablet, but can't use it anymore due to garbled voices. It sounds like a foreign language & not Understandable
Its a very useful app able to connect with friends. I had no any problem with the last version ...audio and video was all perfect.However when i updated the new version i started experiencing audio problem...the sound its so distorted...kindly improve on this.
This is very good, but there is no connection in it. The man will keep connecting. Make the video quality a bit better.Make the video quality a bit better.And the speed of the net should be good, like downloading the speed of the play store, etc., and the speed is very good. There must be something in this way.
Has developed a bug with the latest update of the mobile version. As a host, I am unable to share any document or screen with the participants. I am using a Vivo phone for the mobile app.
It's very good and useful.just a request...plz add up the feature of zooming the video of a person. The option is only for shared screen. But if this feature of focusing on the video...the text on the video will be visible...like the video of a teachers blackboard can be focused.plz look into this
"Iam a student iam using this app from last 4 months.it working good in starting but from last update this is making so much problems. When my video is (on )but showing (off)in participate list and disconnecting ÃƒÂ§lass so many times when I have full network also,when iam rejoining that time it showing ""preparing meeting"" simpliy . by this problem iam missing my very important ÃƒÂ§lasses ,so please solve this problem"
Whenever I share my screen on my mobile with a smart TV while using zoom, the audio does not transfer to the TV. This only happens with zoom. Also, when I pair with a Bluetooth speaker, the audio is really poor.
Ohhh this is best app but now there are updates only but not improvement so that i also use but there is one improvement in one thing that you also no zoom app so well try you can do better next time i also edit my rewivew Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Â¤Â©Ã°Å¸Â¤Â©
I like Zoom but one of the trouble spots is the permissions a co-host has. A co-host cannot setup breakout rooms while another host is managing other meeting details. Breakout room management, if you have to do it manually, is a huge job if you have a lot of people in your meeting, and it would help if the 2nd host could do it! Please change co-host permissions!
I can't put profile pic here. It works good but it often lags. I think something like microsoft teams would be better if it is upgraded like that
I only have a tablet to use Zoom on and it only show 4 people at one time, to see everyone else you have to swipe the screen. Being one of five it was ok at first as I could hide myself and see my brothers and sister, but since the update I can't do this anymore, so one of them is always on a different screen so it is hard to interact when I have to keep swiping backwards and forwards. Would much rather look at them all than have to see myself.
Heyy 3 stars cause it was good till last 2 weeks Since the last 2 weeks zoom is giving a lot of problem in connecting for classes. I have miss 2-3 same classes continuesly It would be very nice if the officials took a look in my matter and resolve it as soon as they could And it's not a network issue for sure Because insta, watsapp,face and all such apps using heavy network work all good all the time It would be very nice if u all could solve the issue as fast as possibl
Has problems. I signed out from zoom and uninstalled it. Again when I installed it and tried to sign into my account then it showed incorrect password or email. But both was correct. Then I changed my password and tried to log in with the app but it always said invalid password or email.
When we are in meeting then it is automatically it will come out of the meeting so it happens many times that is a very big problem for me and another one is when I am speaking then the other's voice is not able to listen so.
Good. But occasionally disconnects despite stable internet connection.
My camera doesn't work. I switch it on from my side but in participants list it's shows off. It needs to be fixed. As I have already uninstalled and reinstalled it thrice but still the problem persists.
There are many lag while a meeting is on and sometimes the screen blackout without any reason
I didn't like it much coz of the virtual background option that they gave that we can change our virtual background only when you have a specific processor on your Android and that I didn't like and sometimes in a meeting when my video is on but in the participants list it shows that it's off.
It would be good when we on our video and come out it should be frozen ,this is because when we on and come out the video gets off. Otherwise this app is very useful. I would rate 5 stars if this would happen.
This two weeks my front camera got so dark I barely see anything with enough lighting. I switched to my camera app. Nothing wrong. Only when I'm using the app.
First of all its a good app but it automatically disconnects or starts to crash ,lag after a certain time . And I can't use it across devices as it says your password is incorrect even if it is correct .
Don't this Application have more reaction emoji's in gallery view . Our teacher has disabled chat, we can't always unmute ourselves to say smaller things right.
Was VERY good before last update (late Sept. 2020), but now the video freezes every 3 seconds or so (all: mine and other participants). The same change happened in 2 different Android devices with the latest update. Please fix! (and test better before releasing updates in the future :)
Clear visuals, sound variable. Data usage high- up to 1G/2 hr meeting.
After updated, not allow to share screen In videos, and no more user friendly.
Zoom has been A learning experience as for everyone else. Yes, it has its issues & gliches. I have to say, I'm greatful to the Zoom app creaters. This has been the key to communication for students in distance learning. Comunicate in zoom meetings with School districts with staff and parents. Good!
Due to New update we are facing a lot of Problem If you go to participants list or chat or do some other work on phone, instead of pousing video it stops it and this is utter discomfort to me and many other ZOOM users only reason why my kids school teachers are prefering GOOGLE MEET and JIOMEET for important Mettings. Hope you fix it.
Mobile users while screen sharing isn't working with video cam..
I had never heard zoom meeting app before covid 19 . Not a bad app . I am having good experience with this app. But yes there is some issues like delayed sound, blurry videos. like that some issues are there and that's why I gave 3Ã¢Â­Â only.
Good app but my problem is most times i get into the meeting, I hardly hear what they say? I always get a write up that says your microphone is muted and I just wonder why. I think the procee needs to be checked
They all should have added a feature in which we can see that which option in poll we had chose. And also there should be more features in this app to use it easily. While,this app is great Thank you for such a great app.
Wooooo.... .what a nice app for my online classes. I have rated it only 3 stars because am not able to record the meeting as a participant so please give an option to record the meeting also for the participants. After that I will rate it 5 stars and share the app to more people.
I use this app every day. But i can't sing in. But it's useful for everyone. Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
It's definitely a great app but just a minor issue which is, everytime i try to sign in even though i put correct id and password it shows incorrect password try again. Do solve the issue
"Zoom was doing good but the 2nd last update of zoom has changed my thought about zoom. In the ""What's new"" portion though it was written zoom will support virtual background but it didn't. If zoom could fix this I will be so grateful. However, zoom is very nice app except the above written problem."
This app has come a long way on Android. However, please add the ability to view more than four people in Gallery view for Android Tablets, specifically for the Samsung Galaxy Tab series. The only thing holding back the tablets are companies like Zoom giving the apps comparable tablet support like they do for iPadOS.
It was installed on my pc i couldnt find a way to open it and only option to sign in was on my phone through my pc and didnt work
At first its good .but now we are facing too much problem.like poor network configuration.and mic will not work properly sometimes we should disconnect amd reconnect audio to speak.its disappointing and loosing interest towards it . Nowadays its becoming too much irritation of bugs while attending meetings. Hope fix all the issues and bugs .
I only can't do 2 things in Zoom................................................................................................................so I reduce 2 stars..........................................the first thing in Zoom which I can't do is I can't enable the disabled chat...................the second thing is I can't change the background in Zoom...........but zoom app is so much fun...........in this time of lockdown, my daughter got a chance to meet my friends because of this app.....
This app is nice but after the latest update I am putting my video on but it is showing that in participants that my video is off and I cant join the meeting
Hey, developer Thanks for making this awesome app, All are now able to study and meet eachother during this pandemic year. But my problem is when I open zoom, I fill the ID and when I fill password it shows incorrect password. I checked that password many times then also it shows incorrect password. Please solve the problem.
I have used ZOOM before and it really consumes a lot of data especially for a student like me who needs to thrift. I wish that your next update can be more convenient for everyone. Thank you and keep safe.
This is good to connect with students and also teacher's staff.
Lots of problems lately. Gallery view option for tablets is gone, remote control is not the same. This app worked so much better before the covid influx. What a shame the overload has affected what was once a 5 star app
I will rate it only three stars because before update it worked well, I have no problem to update it but after updating it is not proper I ask you people to improve the updates and make it the best app , and give little more additional settings, and make it best Ã°Å¸â€™Â¯ app. Because I never uninstalled because I believe that you can improve but after updating if it is proper I will rate it five 5Ã¢Æ’Â£ my surety By Emil Those who believe in my words rate me Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂyesÃ¢Å“â€¦ thank you Ã°Å¸Å’Â¹Ã°Å¸ËœÅ 
Well . It had connection problems earlier but now it is fine but there was a problem with it so I uninstalled it and now when I am trying to reinstall it . It is not downloading . What to do now . But yes earlier it was very good and worked perfectly.
Very bad experience in my life they are telling that virtual background support to android and android means mobile. When I update it nothing.Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ . I am telling that no one should download it. Hmm... Bogas app
Most of the time while in zoom meetings we are ok, sometimes it freezes but over all I guess it helps us give and receive information with our kids teachers. Thank you for the app. Especially During these difficult Covid days at home.
I have so many gliching or frozen pictures and the Volume is very very Low to the point I can't hear the one Speaking and if I wasn't also experiencing while on Zoom it blanking me completely out of my Zoom Meeting and goes to the main screen then it blanks back to the Zoom Meeting it does this aleast several times while I'm on an important Zoom meeting which cause me to miss valuable information ....
I like this app but the reason I give it three stars because it's capacity is very low only 100 people can join and the time limit is too short , only 40 mins time is there so these were two things which I don't like but my family members stay far so we can be connected with them
It is good app, but there is issue that my class is connect after few minute it shows error code and my camera is on but when I am going to check it in participation box it shows that my camera is off. From this issue my school teacher absent me , I am facing this problem from 2 months. Please try to solve that....
Uses a lot of internet. When I turn on my camera this app uses a lot of internet. Everyday my 1.5 gb data gets over.
What's wrong with this app Everytime I join online class, there's no sound at all I've retried it many times, but still there's no sound
I love this app the reason I have given only 3 stars was normally my face looks so healthy and fair but in zoom camera my face looks very black if there will be face beauty camera so I will give 5 stars plz update this app and also when host see our chat when meeting is going on when I write reply in chat if there is mark that host has see our reply so I will give 5 stars like whattsapp tick mark then we can got that host has see reply my video is showing off in participants list help me plzÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¢
I've been using Zoom for a long time, and it was good, however, nowadays I've been having a lot of problems with this app. I get disconnected and connected over and over again, which is too bothering. I would really appreciate if you will consider fixing the problem as soon as possible.
Audio is not transmiting, please fix his thank you for the awesome app.
Cost Too much money for the upgrade plan. There should be more than 40min. Especially since our world has so many challenges and this is one of the options to keep in contact with each other.
I would recommend a confirmation message or option when muting/unmuting and activating/deactivating the mic and camera. I believe this would be a great safety feature for any accidents broadcasted. Turning on your mic and video without confirmation can cause persons to do so unaware which may broadcast sensitive information.....
I get a lot of freezing and sometimes loose connection altogether! It is not my signal as everything else works well, but I even bought a new devise thinking it needed updating, alas I'm still experiencing the same problems
It is good app but I'm giving 3 stars because it is having virtual back ground only in laptops and computer . This feature is not in mobile phone . So I request you to add this feature in mobile phones also.
I was not able to copy link sometime . becouse the copy option was not displaying and it was to angerfull time,Searching for copy option , And One day after update the aap was always lagging during webinar.
This app is good for the online classes but few children are joining the class with others name and misbehaving if there would be a feature of how to get someone's phone number on zoom it would be great. Thank you
Overall good app but chromecast option and audio source option needed in the app. I want to use my smartphone camera and mic as video and sound input and my TV screen as video and sound output. For better experience. Thanks.
It would be ok if we could change name instead of having to use numbers to try to get into classes that won't let you in because you can't change to name. Students need names not number to connect to their classes or they can't get to on line class. Need to fix this problem .
Excellent app service Fix this bug -Turning off of video while moving to participants page
Zoom is a good platform for online classes and meetings. But it would have been a lot better if they allowed each and every client whether on desktop or smartphone to have a 16:9widescreen view.
I have a samsung Galaxy S8 which does not have option for virtual background during Zoom meetings.
I think it really needed an update to have an option to do virtual background mode on Android or in mobile. Especially if your background is unpleasant to see especially in meetings or conferences. I hope I see it on your next update ASAP (messenger calls can do virtual background) Thank you.
After the update many bugs are there. I switch on my camera and after it is turned on my classmates or my teacher cannot see me . This is not my internet problem.
Really good app for my school, although I have to do assignments in class and my camera rurns off. Also, for the Zoom notificcation when your in a zoom meeting, can it have a menu for turning the camera off, etc.
We're thankful for it, tho there can b many challenges with connections/garbled or static background noises(tho none at locations utilized) & video freezing! Abt to do another update. I hope THIS one finally fixed issues!!! Thank you! I wish you continued wellnessÃ°Å¸â„¢â€šÃ°Å¸â€™â€“
The service is good, app ux is bad. The main problem is with speaking. If I navigate to another screen in the app, my mic is muted. Why? I need to stay on the speaking screen to keep talking. This is absurd. Learn from google meet guys. They have fantastic ux.
I dont know what is wrong with this app...i had a class and i couldnt attend it becoz the audio didnt connected for good 30 min and after that i had to leave the meeting ...i have missed my 5 classes becoz of that ...please fix these issues becoz we cant afford problems with such apps because for many they arent source of entertainment and family meetings ..we do all our formal ,office related stuff here
After update, despite the setting of auto connect to call over internet on now I have to do it manually. Its little annoying
It is very amazing app but you really need to increase the time limit to at least an hour so please fix that.
This is very good app but i have something to add in their feature of mute and unmute they should add pish to talk or double tap to unmute any other I was using it and by mistake I tap on Mike and it unmuted
the app is great for connecting in general. I just hope that the zoom for android allows more participants view, similar to ipad that allows 9 participants view at a time rather than 4 view which we need to swipe often to see all people. please consider for more participants view in one screen pls!
At first, zoom was very helpful to me to join meeting from my office but now zoom is not working properly and I can't join any meeting Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¯Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¢Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€™ I gave you three Stars because it was very helpful but it's useless Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¤Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¢Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½ . I'm uninstalling zoom right now Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¤first soon was very helpful to me but now it is useless I am working for it for many and many days but now if I am attending any meeting the meeting ideas coming and coming how many times I write this I am very badly affected from app disgusts
Hello zoom, I faced this problem from new Update . When I Join A room or meeting , when i click start video option , it is okay in the main screen , but when we enter participants option , it shows me stop video icon . But I started my video . I don't it is bug or glitch , you have to fixed it
It's not upto the mark. And secondly it takes a lot of data and it's overall working efficiency is satisfactory.
The main I feel bad in video option, when we turn video, our video shown in gallary view. But, in participants not showing turn on video and show your video is stopped but, I have turn my video. This made me bad impression on this app. So please rectify this mistake on next update as soon as possible. Except this all or well.
I would give it three ( Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸ Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸ Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸ ) stars only because since the last update , after that l am unable to update zoom again. l hope zoom resolves this issue soon.. and l hate zoom , google meet is more better that zoom. So , please never use this app.
The Gallery View has a 4 person limit per screen. This is annoying since I'm using Zoom on an Android tablet. The big screen is completely wasted and it's frustrating to have to shift to different screens every time I want to see a different person speaking.
Not too bad... But most of the time i don't see video but audio is clear... Please fix it.. And inspite of having good network speed it doesn't access minimum speed..
"Well its honestly one of the best ""Meeting"" app the inter face is friendly and it more or less do what is says but the constant crashing lagging.. its just Annoying thats my main nit pick but the inviting system is nice the most easiest to use actually."
Of late i find that the quality of both have gone considerably down and there is a feeling of dissatisfaction at the end of a Zoom meeting. What seemed like a fabulous medium for communication has now become horrible
I have been used this for a long time but I have a problem in it because sometimes it doesn't connects and also it leaves meeting automatically this is the point which me hurt .so please can you fix it I have really faced much problems though it leaves automatically but it is a very useful app for vedio conference and best app for online studies in this covid 19 time
i think that i am very merciful that i gave it 3 starts. because - 1. I can not hear properly 2. i can not see properly 3. it takes time to join 4. at first it says preparing meeting then connecting then waiting room after that again connecting Ã°Å¸ËœÂ© 5. when it again says connecting i again have to turn on my wifi 6. if i turn off my wifi it says webpage not available then again can't join 7. i get disconnected in middle 8. sometimes my cam shows off whether it is on 9. i can't join timely
It is a nice app but the video quality is not good..All other peoples are facing the same prblms.. When my video is on, I go to participants list and it shows my video off.. Due to this I am facing a lot of prblms.. Please give a solution to it..
On my Chromebook I cant change the view or anything
Zoom is a very good meeting app. But for a few days I am facing problem attending meetings using Wi-Fi. The screen is blurry, the sound is not clear. It is my earnest request to zoom to solve my problem as soon as possible. If you don't do it, I will not be able to use this app.
Please Give The Resolution Control Setting For Audio and Video(For Both Receiving and Sending). Some Heating Issues Found While Using This App. Other Than That, This App Was Good.
Good app but a problem is that after every 40 minutes the meeting ends up automatically, which removes the concentration of the students in the pandemic of COVID 19. For getting more better experience I hope the developers will upgrade it to more than 40 minutes or unlimited time...
In this starting it will be fantastic ,when its time to update at that it will misbehave with the participants as like,in the meeting time when the participants will be on visual on their screen, but in the participants list they will think as their video will be off ,,so for this probLem the zoom app managers plzz kindly use this suggestions Thankyou
I want to give it 3 stars because everything is good but one thing is not making me satisfy give some filters in it the camera is very bad i don't like to on video because of it and make audio clear and louder
It good for online. But the fact is that we cannot see the profile photo and we cannot pin all the viedoes in one screen and if we use outher apps the viedo will become statice and it will show viedo will be of in partipertepents. So change this mistakes. If i sould say about this app means it is good. Thankyou
Its very useful for me but it has some defects like not connecting and voice problems
I am giving 3 stars because It's name is zoom But we can't zoom the video.... Why cromecast is not supported in mobile version?
Always the problem is that we can't unmute our selves and can't share screen too .We can only send messages to the host and not for everyone only sometimes we can so the person who created this app please do this and sometimes it disscone
It's a good app with all the facilities. Many updates are coming but i haven't got any update solving my problem. I will wait for an update solving my problem. Plz take care.
This app is very good but there are some problems.1 when someone participant is left due to bad network no intimation is given to the host 2.sometimes I did not heard the host and vice versa. If these problems are solved, I sure that these app is become excellent
Other than the fact I can't figure out how to get phone calls to stop coming through during my zoom meetings that are extremely important with my son that would be the only problem I really have was them otherwise I think it's a fairly good great actually video chat lot better than messenger
Now after updates it become good and all previous problems regarding vedio and voice are solved
It is nice appÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â but after updating it is not functioning properly.Ã°Å¸Â¤â€Ã°Å¸Â¤â€ I am turning on my camera but when I am seeing in participant list it shows that my camera is off yes it shows thisÃ°Å¸Â¤Â¯Ã°Å¸Â¤Â¯. becoz of this there is lot of trouble and wastage of time during examÃ°Å¸ËœÂ§Ã°Å¸ËœÂ§Ã°Å¸ËœÂ°Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¤ .plz correct this problem .then I will 5 stars to this app Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â
This app is good but it have a problem when in a meeting my video is on but it shows that video is of in the participants lists
Seriously there are so many audio problems while I'm using zoom. Like I cant hear nothing, just drtt drtt..
The new update has a lot of problems like when I am muted and I speak something with my family members my voice is transmitted through my earphone and also when i am listening to music during a call the music is audible to the ones on the call.
This is a great app for classes but there are some issues in this app... we can't get any virtual background in this new update and that is sometimes important.. and second, there are some technical issues in this like it automatically leaves the meeting and takes turns to recent after that. It happens several times if you joined the meeting
It is good if we can choose the quality of video and audio so that we can save our data...please give options for different video and audio qualities..like 144p,240p,360p,480p..etc
This app is a very nice app. Only small issues are there..Whenever I join in zoom even though my microphone access to zoom is enabled my audio breaks up . And when I join in zoom meeting it takes so much time for connecting. Hope these issues could be fixed..
it's great for small meetings
This app create me some problems but also this app is very useful to me it is to my class i cant see the clear picture that time and have some technical issues also but also this app is so nice good well and good willing
"Hello. Please make it possible for the host to access the ""raise hand"" feature. Sometimes a host may not be the anchor of a meeting but a participant, eg when a meeting is in the form of a symposium"
It is a very good meeting app. But the video and audio cracks a little bit. And suddenly it disconnects and connects again.it is not very complicated, it is very easy to access.I am waiting for new updates.
Please add video filter for zoom mobile, i will rate 5 star immediately!!!!!!!!
Im experiencing a problem.. My camera wont turn on for others, but for me its working fine, My teachers are constantly complaining that I intentionally off my camera to cheat on a test.. For others my camera is off but for me its on.. PLs FIX THIS BUG.. ITS VERY ANNOYING
Many times meeting get disconnected. Its very frustrating
I have some problem the problem is that we can't keep another fonts if we keep it will be looking like this (- - - -) so this problem is one of the problem another is we can't delete messages in other will say that what this message. Hope this problem with fix as soon as possible
Since it is my first time to use it , i can see it is helping but the only problem i have so experienced is that i have failed to unmute my zoom microphone , meaning that i am only able to watch the video but not hearing what they are saying
It end after class is goin on a half of the end while maam explaining it is disconnect at the correct time I can't hear any concept and while I am sign up it gives a you are not eligible to sign up the zoom very several times , it gives me a irritation
It's pretty good with a weak connection. But. The texts in chat box shouldn't delete when I get disconnected. Please try to ad subtitles
It is very useful but there are some problems . I hope you will update them
Whenever a phone call interrupts the meeting phone becomes abnormal, after rejecting or attending the call, again when directed to meeting the audio is lost after sometime leaving the meeting, booting the phone and reinstalling the app it comes to normal. Everytime this issue irritates me
Difficult to problem solve. Thought paying for premium would make setting up a meeting to be easy and self explanatory... Nope. It sucks. Help page not helpful. Premium also created a different account rather then the one I use on other devices.
Visual quality it is blurred has so many network problem sound is delayed which does not match with the video .
It's good for mass meetings. I would have given 5 stars, but it does not get connected at times. Other areas it gets connected but mine shows incorrect password.
I wanted to record one meeting but it said zoom cannot record audio temporarily i only get the video recorded bit no audio I am facing this from August still it shows the same whenever I want to record the meeting please update it so that in any emergency I can record both audio and video please do it . Apart from this everything is good.
Good but time duration should be long and should also have been option to share ppt and vedios
It is really best a app for meetings , because they use cloud meeting formula and it is loosing two stars because they didn't kept an virtual background for android ,if they try they can do but they didn't so.
When i get a private video call i only see the video icon on top of my phone it doesn't ring and light up to accept or reject call . I have to keep clicking on to video then going back then a few seconds it lights up on my screen
I am using this app from 8 months and i am satisfied but from yesterday i can't use it and i can't attend my important meetings there is showing some network problem but my network is working good while using other app. HELP ME PLEASE Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â
Too many glitches, you need to go back to the solid red indicator for the camera and microphone. Was hard for the elderly to see if they are muted or not.
I am genuinely rating this app as three big is the facilities that are provided unlimited not more than hundred people can join in a meeting the meeting blocks when more than hundred people join and you have to create the meeting again and again after 40 minutes that the worst part of the meeting overall the app is good but there are some glitches that the app needs to to explain and correct the Zoom app as the India's number one app thank you so much for providing such great things but you need
Its is a good app which helps teachers to teach their student's but it needs more internet sometimes server would be down but this is good to have meeting with childrens for online schooling
Good app very less video problem and its fantastic for meeting and video calls but it is showing some problems of the video off when we open participants or go to other recent tabs it switchs off the video. I would like to give five star when this problem is solved
Zoom only works well if you have an excellent internet connection. Otherwise, the quality is poor. I'm fortunate to have good internet. I always have good quality video and sound.
It's a very good app for students but y i have given only three stars because it's not updating to 5.3.52540. 0920 from 5.3.1(52883.0928) which is used for virtual background effect.I have searched everything how to apply background effect.All have updated but my amdroid phone is not updating.I have reported too.so i think u will rectify. Thank u
After the last update my screen share is completely off.
Host should also unable to read private chat.
Nice app but how to use background picture settings in android
very usefull and helpful
Swiping from right to left has lag
My zoom is working like PC help me
I have many network issues automatically your video will get switched off .
Itvis a quite useful app especially for school online classes and this medium of learning has not let the studies stop even in these trying and challenging times . I hope the goodness embarks forever
Please bring out new features like pop up window , like to switch to small window of total zoom meeting on homescreen or other apps for using other apps alÃƒÂ³ng with zoom meeting ( as small screen on phone or tab same like in whatsapp video call)
Application is good but virtual background should be considered
It help me.Ã¢ËœÂºÃ¢ËœÂºÃ¢ËœÂº
Zoom is a great video conferencing app and it's very valuable in this period of covid. Everything is fantastic. But plz enable virtual background for lower android devices so that all can use this feature. Do fix this.
The clarity of voice is not good
I am really satisfied but some option make your app the best video conference app like Why can't you make a seprate app for students in which there can options like No student can exit the classroom without permission and No students can enter without mandatory information needed by teacher like ph.No,email ID or School ID and A option which can make absentees list on its own by the attendance list already entered by the teacher.This can make everyone to use Zoom school version. Please consider
Better to set no time limit
Gorgeous app
Not good experience Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€™
There is a very bad problem face , Zoom video doesn't not working properly Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
How I can I get back zoom old version because I am not liking this new update
just nice
Good but sometimes I have problem in joining the meeting .Zoom can still improve .
Its not good and its not bad.... Because the school classes are boring for me(Aroush Noorani) and my brother (tall no or an I).
You should give one option of refresh so that sometime the video is getting blured it can improve by refreshing .
Its very frustrating
Have good.
Waste app do not use very fast slow app
It's not work properly.
App is good but the new version is making a problem of cemera off /on the old version is best plzzz solve this problem this making more problems in study

Very interesting app
I still can't record ny meeting with the shared screen this option is only for tabs, laptops and pcs but not available for the phone.
I like using zoom but it qont let me make ab account after i deleted it
There should more facilities as this is the prime video meeting app in our country
It is fine bcz it doesn't allow sound recording
Not bad Ã°Å¸ËœÂ
Zoom is a good app but when i go in participant list then my camera is off

It's not time friendly
Nice app ..very useful.. But..few times it was not connecting the meeting. But it is useful...

Not sure on his Zoom works as a leader never bern leader just particpant. Got multiple screens though if you mean that
I have kicked off a lot
i cant change my profile picture and also my video gets off.
Kept disconnecting then reconnecting
Amazing app!
It is useful app
Thus is good but if we will go to Participate list and in chat the video is getting off pls fix it
The app is much good.But,there is a severe problem in connecting.I always face a great problem in joining to class.It is not my wifi problem.I have a strong wifi connection and it works.The only and main problem is in your app.And please,enable the deleting option in zoom.It is very much annoying when you give a message to the wrong person.Your app is educative and everybody is using it in lockdown. Zoom authority is not taking any action to fix the problems. Please,I request you to fix it.Ã°Å¸ËœÂ©Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
I will give it a 3 star because some time it will snd u a message that an error occured. But my friends didn't have the problem
After the last update I'm facing too much problem in connecting.. Truly disappointed...
Have not use it .
"Good app but sign up everytime showing ""You are not eligible......"""
It is not good
Its a good app
Decent app just haven't had a chance for a meeting yet. I will edit as soon as i get my first
It needs to Add 250 people like Google meet..
Good video meeting
Easy to use but some improvements must be done to make app better 1.when we on our cam or some of the apps it disconnects from the meeting which is so annoying Ã°Å¸â„¢â€ž 2.it stucks Improve your app to make it awesome Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’
No background for android
Nice app need improvement in the transition from one screen to another. Also, please reduce the INTERNET consumption as it drains major part of my data, around 250-300 mb!!!!! Please team zoom help!!!!!
Good job
It is amazing but sometimes I can't check my profile it doesn't show profile only
Nice some
I am not able to change virtual background.
We can better go for Google met
Can you make an option called screan lock. Or put a warning message when touch unmount or start video.
good but data required is more
Please provide an option to stretch the video meeting. The video gets cropped when I select scale to fit option. Please provide an option.
Requires high data speed
Hello zoom team App is good but so please help me out and solve my problem.. I have already reported this problem from zoom app Thank you
Not so great.
limited participants could bi viewed
Please enable zooming option, otherwise we can't see letters while our online classes going on
Please give permission to record internal audio please please Sir so that we can record and revise it again. As we are not going school due to corona virus so it will be easy to see the recording and understanding the concepts again. Please Zoom meeting owner give Permission to record internal audio. Thank you Sir Ã°Å¸ËœÅ  I hope you will take it seriously and allow it . Thanks again Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸ËœÅ Ã°Å¸Â¥Â°
Not rlly good. ;-;
Its a Good app but the reason why i,m giving it 3 stars is that, It Sometimes Crashes and says that your meeting Password is not correct even if the Password Ã°Å¸â€â€˜ is Correct . Please Fix this Bug .
But it is not work on some conditions plz fix properly
The video is not clear
I am unable to select my profile picture. I try 10-15 times to sign in but 'You are not elligible to sign in yo zoom'
Amazing
Very good Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â
It would be better if there was message deletion options too
Good app. But sometimes it kicks me out from a meeting. And sometimes poor video and audio quality. And almost every week a update arrives. Try to fix the bugs and problems. But a good app. Thank you.
It is so good for familys video calls & so nice for meetings and for online classes also
who have unlimited wifi can use as cctv camera as well as very easy to use
Please provide message delete option
Nice app, I wanted to give 5 stars but network issues are very annoying and I hate them, that's why only 3 start given
Please remove that new feature that we go to chat or another app our video is off and another feature is all right
Good app. Good achievement but need some more improvement
very nice app to study
nice app
It's good
Nice app but many connectivity issues occur.
It is good app but I am unable to change background effect plz make it easy to change
Best app for everyone.At first whenever I goes on another app, the video was remaining on. But after the update it gets off. There Should be Virtual Background should also be there on Mobile (Android).
I am a student whenever I open the participant list my camera turns off and then teacher thinks that we are playing a game or roaming here and there please fix this and plz make sure hackers or students are coming in our classes and saying
We can't delete the message that we have sent by chat and We can't get time.
Somthing better
I've got one suggestion for the latest zoom feature to suspend participant activities.Although it completely freezes the entire meeting yet the miscreants manage to escape. This feature should also include freezing the leave meeting button.
It is good for school but how can you use a background and filter in zoom
What about automatically lowering hand, after 5sec when answering? Thank you
the app works great but the pc app is better than the mobile app so pls improve the mobile app.
Zoom is the best for meeting,but drawing tools are not better.
I have turned on my video when i go for participants list it will show video is turned off
use not crashed
I agree with some people with the virtual background i dont have that i need to use that for my chrismast activity
Its little annoying
Recent Update prevents Sign Out I have more than one account, now I can't switch.
I can't use virtual background.
Live captioning would be ideal.
Love the classes but can't get ANY sound. Would like to jear the instructor
Make your lite app for android 4

Its very bad app
When my teacher let me share my screen it won't let me.Ã°Å¸â„¢Æ’Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
I can do class everyday perfectly but l don't like the part that when you get kicked out of a meeting to join that meeting again you need to uninstall the app and download it again
Worst app..Ã°Å¸Â¤Â®
It asks for Id- password! And I am late for meetings
Good.....it is easy to use and to communicate with each other... however I will recommend you to use this app...and for zoom I would keep going and keeping helping everyone in the time of pandemic
It's great but I don't love school
You should give a option to control the voice of each and everyone from 100 so we can control others voice like in discord
This is reliable app
Good thing is that it is very good for online studies and bad thing is that it uses too much battery and internet
Meeting drops down twice in 30 minutes. Its very frustrating
nice zoom app
Video is not clear
Please improve internet connectivity. It suddenly loses its connectivity when there is little bit internet connection problem.
Iam not getting audio while the meeting is running ,plz help me how to unmute my audio
The system of vedio is very bad If we go into the participant list the vedio goes off
Nice but there no more options of delete the chat or message.

Good for meetings but video quality is poor.
While my vedio is on and I am using other app so I think it seems like my vedio is off so do something so that while my vedio is on and I am using other app so it should be look like it is on
Features and optimization are good

Havnt used it myself yet but friends hav told me it's good
Sign in is not working
It can not connect ask same questions over and over.
I'm having a problem...it is that after I sign in with my account into the app and put up a profile picture I am unable to remove or change the picture... whenever I try to do so, a message is shown that editing is not supported...but this function was available before...I would really appreciate it if you look into the matter so that the function is re-enabled...apart from all this, it is a good appÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ»

Yeah it's a good app but, still it creates a problem. Sometimes it create problem that it doesn't connect with the meeting it shows the error. And also sometimes video quality is so poor.
Good app for online classes but sometimes this app will not work good there Will be severe problems like the hosts audio will not come properly the video will not be clear etc . So the developers should update it more. And plz add the feature of duration of class more than a hour
Works
This app is not good
nice videocall
Good app meetings
The worst app i have ever saw
You are not able to see our video in participant list when you open it
Good but not better
Not good app not get that type of facilities
Virtual background only available on IOS?? Well... This is suck.
Its really good Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ»
It's good ...
THIS NICE APP FOR LEARNING.AND TUTION.ZOOM OWNER DO MORE TIME THEN 40 MINUTES
It's a good app for meeting, teaching purpose etc...
There were some issues when sign in
it's easy to use
I think it's worth 3 stars because its bad app
It's okay Ã°Å¸ËœÅ½Ã°Å¸ËœÅ½ for my classes because i am using Wi-Fi improve the for next generation Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â
This is a Very good and helpful app for meetings, classes etc.So I Rate this app 3.
Signal is weak
Good app,But not Hd meeting quality Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¢
Please give recording option in mobiles
Over power
No doubt it is very good and very helpful app but it really consumes a lot of data and i am facing a lot of problems with zoom now a days so i request the zoom server to fix the sevral bugs. Other wise no problem it is vey good source of communication with the world.
Not good
Best app for learning and meeting .Please improve the audio clearance during all unmuted
It's a very good platform to interact with the students
Nice but in this app there is some problems
This app so much problem ....first of all it don't allow to show face Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¢
It should allow recording classes from phone also..
Unbetween of class it is going out, little annoying
Because I have 3 stars only that there is no option of unmute by our selves host can only unmute me
This app is really good for kids regular classes and etc
Easy to use. However, for those who don't have unlimited data, for some reason now, it will start sucking your data, even when you are actively on WiFi the whole time. My wife started with 1 GB, and within 2 days, Duo are 300MB. Wifi never was turned off. Never left the house. Never happened before. Even went and put data restrictions on the app specifically and that still didn't work. She had to uninstall it to stop it from eating get data for the month. Right now, she has half a gig left
This app is amazingly useful. As it opens a lot of opportunities for everyone to connect with. 4 stars would be the highest for me. It supposed to be 5 but since this app virtual background doesn't work in some android mobile devices just like mine. I guess that's the only thing they needed to improve. As not all people can adjust and buy a new mobile device.
I hate it when chat gets cleared after bad connection. Like if I get knocked off the meeting and I sign it back, previous messages are empty. I wish the messages would still remain in these instances, it would be helpful. Otherwise, the app is good, i really enjoy it.
It works properly but sometimes when you put the right password it shows that it's wrong and you can't enter the meeting again because it disconnects, my disconnected many times but I again return to the meeting with no problem but one day i experienced the password problem and I asked my friend and she told me that this happened with her too. Please fix this problem as soon as possible. That's why I am rating this app 4 stars.
I wouldgive this app five stars but I can't. This is a very good app but the problem is that even when I have full internet connection or even use data the meeting goes away and tells I don't have any connection. And also during the meeting, a writing comes telling that I have an unstable connection even if i have strong connection. This app needs a lot internet to go smoothly. Or else this app is very good to do meetings and classes.
Plesw add some update it hasn't come from a month. Although the application is very good but regular updates needs to be installed. Please look into it. After the update the auto connect ti audio option is removed and is not fuctioning. Please look into the matter. Hope you find my review helpful.
Good app for educational work. It's good about meeting and clear voice. One fault had occurred after update is it's settings ' call over internet ' automatically actually don't work. It was working before update. Just fix this problem. Although, overall it's a nice app.
Fantastic interface makes so much possible, but quite a few problematic glitches. Layout inconsistent across different devices so things you need are suddenly not there-teaching hell. Zoom also changes layouts w/o notice. Pulls the rug out from under your plans. Teaching art requires multiple cameras making it necessary mute all but one sound device to prevent feedback. But you can still here munchkin voices no matter how hard I try. Its like a snipe hunt.
A year later and Zoom hasn't fixed this bug.... Love Zoom but there are some bugs. If you join or host a meeting from the Android app using VOIP 'device audio', if another call is received on your phone during the Zoom conference, when the phone call ends you are returned to the Zoom conference however nobody can hear you when you speak even though you do not appear to be muted in Zoom. You must leave the Zoom conference quitting the Andoid Zoom app and reload Zoom to enable the microphone.
It is good and is getting better the features and the overall service quality has gone up significantly since the beginning of 2020 like with smartsharing. Video quality. sound quality, security and less interference and inleruptions. It still needs more Emojis for collective reactions while video chatting. Works fantastic for church services!
I don't like that some features don't work on all devices. Zoom works the worst on Chrome! You can't see your list of meetings from Chrome or save the chat to a file.. You can't assign people into breakout rooms from anything but a P.C. My audio and video work best from my android. But, overall I still give it a 5 star rating because most of those things are probably the limitations of the devices and not Zoom.
I am rating four stars because the audio, video, chat option, raise hand, rename, screen sharing and all the other features are available in every meeting...i am using this app to attend my all classes....and this is so amazing and wonderful app....but one mistake is there that when I see my video in the participants list, then, its shown as 'off' but my video is always 'on'.... Thank you
Needs a bit of work, such as allowing the entire app to remain in landscape mode, the audio outputs need more fine tuning; ie there's a speaker option and a 'quiet' option, what's with that? I'd also prefer it if the tabs in the 'more' section were all moved to the main functions bar, it feels cumbersome on mobile. Otherwise brilliant!
Easy to use with Clear instructions on how to proceed. Picture quality is good but occasional interruption by fluctuating reception issues. There is need to improve background features. Maybe I need to learn how to add backgrounds. Good system and I have enjoyed using it for meetings and interviews. Dr Benjamin UK
Most of the time all the parts of the app are working but sometimes the connection is not good. It usually only takes about 15 seconds for the screen to come back if the internet runs slow. With my device I usually don't have any problem with the sound quality.
Working very well. But little improvements needed if possible 1. I should be able to set online mute/unmute option to be autohide or not. 2. Main screen should have 3 windows one for showing slides one for speaker and one for user. 3.if I keep mobile in vertical position all windows including all participant should become vertical and horizontal when horizontal. Thanks
This app is very useful for teaching...All features are very good...but...in mobile phone....there is no option of recording...if i use another screen recorder app in this zoom...then it only records screen without sound...and no other app of recording works in this zoom..that's why...i am not able to record my lectures...please update zoom...and give option of recording in moblie phone.....otherwise i am fully satisfied with this app...
I have been using the Zoom app ever since we have been shut down due 2 the current Covid-19 Pandemic. This has been one of the most effective ways that myself & many others from my congregation have been able 2 communicate region 2 region, statewide, within the US & worldwide. It has been an awesome tool 2 use that has gotten better each update. No doubt we are all suffering 1 way or the other during this moment in time. We are grateful 2 technology & the ability 2 communicate!!!!
User friendly, requires little training for managing or hosting. Not too many bells and whistles to distract or compete with engagement. Easily compatible with calendar and reminder tools. Used before the pandemic, and it is still as accessible now as it was then.
This is a pretty good app in my opinion! Great video, microphone, and screenshare usage, and packed with a lot of different features! I would definitely recommend this app, and it's very useful during quarintine as a substitute for students to go to school.
There is a technical fault which came in zoom app. Whenever I open my video it's shows off in participants list. That doesn't happen before. For some days this is happening. Very annoying
Quite nice Served for sometime and it was awesome. The app is quiet amongst the best. But when ever I send a disruptive feedback nothing is done regarding the tool bottons available to the host and data usage. Sometimes it stops without data disruption..and I don't why
Zoom became one of the best video calling app as it have less bugs in compare to google meet and better video and audio quality. But 1 thing is Missing . If they can add a feature such that we can mute and unmute microphone using headphone button then it would be quite good as it becomes quite easy to control. Zoom pc version too became a better meeting app as it releases frequent updates .......
easy to use . good app . nice quality but only problem is sometimes if we have good internet then also it shows reconnecting that is the only problem keeping that a side I love this app a lot and I know it is improving on every update . keep going
Some lags I am using it since 4 months or more than it it's good app but sometimes when I used to try to join a meeting it lags a log and after that we can't even join the meeting and I have one more issue that is virtual background you should make this feature for all Android users it's not fair it supports just for few you should make it for every Android user because many of us are students and using it and I think so they want VirtualB
Have been using Zoom for about a month. GR8 app. I am using it on my tablet which allows me to view 4 participants at a time when I slide the page. I am going to install, it also on my PC so that I will be able to see more persons at our meetings. 5/25/20 I am giving a 5 Ã¢Ëœâ€ Ã¢Ëœâ€ Ã¢Ëœâ€ Ã¢Ëœâ€ Ã¢Ëœâ€  rating. Very much needed at this CRITICAL time. 2nd Timothy 3 1-5 Aug 20 /2020 Having issues since I did the latest update. Zoom works well on my tablet but on my. PC there are still issues. Zoom uses a lot of RAM
I'd give it 5 stars if background photo functionality worked in android. Many apps/programs are better in Android than Windows, and the hardware in my phone is better than most Iphones or ssd laptops. I have the RAM, the processor speed, and up to 2TB of memory in high speed micro SD cards. What's the problem?
This app is nice and it is useful to me for listening Ã°Å¸Å½Â§ my online class Ã°Å¸â€œÂÃ°Å¸â€œÂ and it was superb . I have no words to describe it. Ã¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ°Å¸ËœÂ. But the one and only problem isÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€Ã°Å¸ËœÅ¾ it is taking more net and charging those 2 are problems that's it so I given 4 star rating . And the remaining is superb it was fantastic Ã¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸Â app . If the app will not take more net and charge means I could give the 5 star rating .
It's great allows us to have church virtually. I do wish I could change my profile picture from my android phone though, but I only seem to be able to do it on my ipad pro. I wish the functions were the same no matter what device you're using...because it is an up to date smartphone. Don't see why changing my picture isn't an option.
It helps a lot to interact with people in this hard time....bt It needs to be improved ,The Vedio should not get off automatically when we switch to other apps , it should use less internet and yes it should have more no. Of people at one time....Thank uh and well a very helpful app for everyone Ã°Å¸ËœÅ 
I've updated the app after long time. Could you please fix one thing. When I turn to the list of participants or go to open any other app, my screen to the other participants turns black. Earlier it used to freeze itself.
It is an amazing app ,but the reason behind I have given only four star is that when my classes are going on that time in participants list my video is showing off besind my name ,but actually my video is on ,even I updated this app on 18th Nov 2020 last .So it is my humble request to check the app settings.
Zoom does it and when I go to participent's list my video turns off And my voice and teacher's voice are strucking.what can I do?And when I put the meeting password it comes it's wrong but when I check it came wrong again so uninstalled and reinstalled.
feedback: recommend to add a function like teacher can put all the photo before the class started and then they just need to scroll to turn next page, so teaches x need to present a photo one by one, its really waste time:), thanks
Zoom is really a good application. Mainly it is useful to the students and teaching staffs. I wish to give 5 star's but there is a problem that it take lot of data usage, developer's this is my request, please look on it and solve it.
It is very adaptable during this time period involving social distancing. No posting of information. Wish it could be adaptable for the hearing impaired and other areas of disabilities.
IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m very happy with this app except the fact that it does not allow CUSTOM ringtones. That is indeed why i gave 4 stars. I will surely change it to 5 stars, along with the review that zoom is one of the most productive applications in this entire universe, once my suggestion is taken into consideration...
Excellant app but, 1. Uses more mobile data. 2. Need to upgrade the app. 3. Need to add some more features. These are the advantages and disadvantages of the app that I have noticed.
Its a good app. It can help people talk to each other but one problem there is that if we sign in it does not allow people born in 2000s, or even before i guess i don't know, to have an account so please enable this as without signing in it is impossible to host a meeting.
When you go onto the gallery view it goes very slow and laggy..
We have access to 2g internet only from more than a year and this is one among those apps which run smoother on 2g also. But i give 4 stars only and that is because when i mute my mike, my screen recorder doesn't record the audio of meeting.
I can't seem to join my audio now. I have been using this app since post lockdown. It was fine till now. Now i can't seem to join the audio. My classes are conducted via zoom. Now i can't hear a word if the lecture. Could you please look into it? Thank you.
The reason I gave four stars because in between the meetings it's disconnecting and again connecting and it's really hard for me.Please fix my zoom..even though I update it same continues again...Please make it...other than it it's really good!
"The chatting system is good but it needs to be developed more.....Ã°Å¸Â¤Â·Ã°Å¸ÂÂ»Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â„¢â€šÃ¯Â¸Â features like ""last seen "" and "" message seen"" should be added to it , 4 star only because of the poor chatting system, please help that"
I have given you 4 star because there is a wrong thing in this app when I tried to join a meeting it will show that the host will let you in soon, but if the host is not letting in soon the meeting will end and we would not understand anything in the meeting so I request to the developer that to make a setting in this app that when if I enter in a meeting I can go easily without any problem and it should not show that the host will let you in soon
Zoom has been a wonderful tool since the pandemic started. It's a little clunky sometimes and not intuitive, but that will come with maturity. Would be nice to have a countdown clock visible all the time. Thanks for the free Thanksgiving extra time.
All good with this app, But the problem is can't use this app through my wifi, there is some error, I always have to use internet even though I have my wifi at 100mbps but the meeting doesnt starts and if it starts nothing can heard and cant receive videos or screenshare. Please try to fix the problem.
I have good experience with the zoom meetings and the cloud helping us out but like I said earlier on the feedback some people that enter the cloud and the zoo meetings are using two devices and that puts a strain on our connection and I wish if I'm correct I wish the zoom the cloud would let all participants know that using two devices does put a strain on their connection if I'm correct I would like to zoom cloud team to back me up and put that out there you know they're interruptions during t
Awesome app . I am not going to say anything more . But Problems : (1.)Problem here is that when we go to participants it will show your video off whether it was of or on Ã Â²Â _ÃŠâ€“Ã Â²Â .
Real time experience. I have enjoyed doing a book study with my friend via zoom. Both the audio and the video has been clear. A bit of downtime which I thought was a network problem on my end. But it's a good app!
I want a new feature to this app.... Which is a chat message delete option... Because while meeting sometimes people accendently send wrong/Bad messages and we can't get this message deleted, just only can copy, so it would be better to delete it right away.... I hope this chat message delete feature will get added.....
A very good app. But one problem is whenever I share a video or movie,The other participants are not able to see the screen,or the motion of the pictures also appears to be disturbed(it breaks)
Some of the meetings have been excellent; others have been difficult to maintain participation as there were echos, freezing of speakers and twice, my screen went completely blank. On the whole, it has been a worthwhile experience. Thank, you for the access to this technology which has eased the challenges of the lockdown.
Building education through the Zoom App is much easier. Even if we can't go to school, we can in on our daily learning activities with the Zoom App. This is very useful for students. But it is a bit difficult to create a meeting in this.
Good app!!!...I like it for using it as my video conferencing app it has nice quality. But sometimes I felt that the voice of organiser is not clear even if I have good network
This app is best... i gave 4 stars bcoz I am not able to set profile photo.... why I wanna know the reason why it is happening so..... zoom team plz replay me and tell me why it is happening..... and help me i want set my profile pic..... they are telling unable to load photo.
So far I have used this app, it is good. Biggest thing is it is the need of the hour and it is free. whatever problem i have faced, all because of network connectivity.
At the comfort of my home for many meetings via zoom, clear audio, great vision on people's video and the timing is just mind blowing, yet not a single risk on traveling from point A to B.
This app is good but now l can't login(sign in)in my PC and l didn't know why!!!It just appears a screen(You are not eligible to sign in in this time)Please please fix it and this will be a good app
An excellent app. I enjoy using it, it makes the world smaller & people nearer. but it needs to make auto updates without asking to make it manual. During the meeting the app stopped suddenly and ask for update Ã°Å¸â„¢Ë†Ã°Å¸â„¢Æ’
It is very useful for students to learning the lessons and useful for teachers to teach the lessons for children very easily. there are so many options like if children unmute themselves the host will able to mute them and if children is not oning the video,the host is able to start the children video but the zoom developers have develop like this if the children or anybody leaving the meeting. The host will able see who is leaving and who are joining . Please develop this
This app has helped me especially during the pandemic we can't go to school we miss our friends but zoom has helped me now I can chat with my friends and still attend classes online the app is better than the duo and Google meet so for me I give it 4 stars
My Zoom experience has been a good one with great visual and audio quality. It does freeze up sometime. That usually happens on my tablet.
I think this app is pretty good and if you have a meeting on zoom planned you have no choice. sometimes it glitches but I think that depends on the person's device but I think it is a good app.all I can say I don't think is better than Microsoft team if I have a choice to take an app that I can host meetings I will probably choose host a meeting you should choose Microsoft this app has a lot of different types of stuff that is handy
Zoom has afforded me opportunities to connect with family near and far. I have been able to connect with church services and work meetings. I have even used it for online trainings. It has been very useful particularly during this pandemic.
1) Using alot data. 9hr with breakout room activities will take up about 2.5GB. 2) Virtual background is working 80% only as sometimes still able to see actual background or ceiling. 3) Occasionally will auto log us out.
Very laggy and has bad quality every now and then, but it's nice because unlike Google Meet you can actually see everyone through pages and makes it easy to talk to more friends/family than will fit on the page.
Great app, serving a good purpose especially with the current situation. But recently no longer functioning properly on my device usually when i join meeting with mobile data.
App is nice but you should create a setting that no intruder can join and disturb the meeting. Such as you should make an option like daily attenders where the host can select the regular attenders so the intruder cannot join.
It is a very wonderful app for students , officers , etc Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¡Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¡i want rate 4 stars because this has network problemÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€¢Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¢ and the video is clearly good apperence but do devolp this app in offline also it is be helpful to every user on this app, and check the audio becuse it not clearier and a very thanks Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Âto devolping like this app mainly i to think devolp it in offline also Ã°Å¸ËœÅ Ã°Å¸ËœÅ 
Good experience at all. I am using this app for my online classes due to COVID-19 pandemic. It impressed me with it's performance but the only thing which disappointed me was voice problem I couldn't hear my teachers when they are teaching the class.
It's a good app for video conferencing and zoom app has many features in it like you can mute and close your video and share screen. It has many options for host also that it can mute anybody, it can chage name of any participants and it can kick any body and etc. If you are looking for a video conferencing app then it is a perfect choice for you.
For all intents and purposes, Zoom is great! It is consistently reliable. It would be nice to see some upgrades; the platform seems a little bare bones but there's lots of potential and I get a lot out of using it.
They Zoom app is good. I would like to see better optimization for different devices, such as better camera quality. I would also like to see a PiP service, like WhatsApp.
I have some issues with this aap. At first it's makes us to leave the meating automatically. I was out of my meeting automatically and I have to join it again, it's a big issiue. Secondly plz make it more powerful so it doesn't lag. It lagged with me once.
It is good app , easy to use, everything good , but only 1 thing I want that the option of virtual background on mobile should come back , please do the same as soon as possible
Sometimes it might lag but it is a good and free option for online classes and little business meets . But it has a limitation of 100 persons at a time .No problems at all
Very helpful app for online classes if internet is strong. I Iike zoom app,it is very easy to learn and understand everything after taking zoom classes.Zoom has made our studies a lot easier But there is one bad thing that we cannot do any recording in zoom class.
Having to get used to new technology; steep learning curve! Glad to have this as I'm shielding, so human contact is very much at a minimum see since March.
The last update is causing problems for me . The app keeps disconnecting despite having good WiFi signal this never happened before the update . And it's not following my meeting settings to connect audio over the Internet upon starting . Why is this happening ?
The app is good and the options are more we can test audio and we can test video and it has good quality of video and audio but one is when I join a meeting in my phone It shows the video preview dialogue box I click the option join with video but when I got the participants option It is showing that my video is offÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¤Ã°Å¸ËœÂ  and please Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­ keep the rejoin option or reconnect option while updating
I love this app bec uncan call anyone from all of the world for example When ur family decided to move lets say Canada u will miss ur friend/friends so u can use zoom to call ur friend/friends and see them in person But the thing that is upsetting me is when ur internet give trouble they kick u out of the chat room
Good app for meetings but sometimes creates connection problem.. My microphone gets muted automatically, how to get through this problem...? Many a times unknown people crashes in the meetings and distrub!
I am giving 4 star because of some problem that is when i was connect from the id after it password part ha not been show due to this i was not able to connect the meeting, overall the app is good, but i request to improve it for some issues
Everything's okay with this application. I suggest a fun feature, to be able to talk with the people In waiting room until the host accepts them.
My video is on but it is showing off in participants option, so please resolve this issue and give us update version of this app and in other things this app is good. Therefore, four Stars, and please resolve the above issues urgently i am facing problems !! My bug is not fixed, please reply
I think zoom is a great app and for the most part but it has one annoying issue. I've seen many other people say they have this issue. Randomly when you're in a meeting and I have my camera and audio on, they will both turn off and I have to put them back on.
Well, the only problem is that i cant send images or videos through the chat . And also i want a change in it , if we are using the app in background the video should still remain open .
It is a very good app ............. But, the problem is we cannot record zoom meeting with Audio... Please keep a feature in this app by which, we can easily record any zoom meeting with both video and audio.............. Please please please Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ» Otherwise it's a great app...Ã°Å¸â€™Â«Ã°Å¸â€™Â«
This app is fantastic for general meetups. No issue in the speed and efficiency. But the time of the basic barient meeting is low. Time increased upto 60 or 70 minutes.
The sound quality is generally good, but sometimes not clear enough to hear music clearly. (Later) Sound quality seems to be improving.
The app is indeed excellent. The only problem which is unclear about is the network type suitable for this App to avoid dragging and network cut offs. Apart from that , everything is perfect.
This is a good app. But we had a lot of problems. But if you sign in, you can get a lot of facilities. You can even put a photo. However, there are many obstacles to sign in.Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€š
App is good for the meetings. But need lots of improvements.. Need to upgrade the interface of the app.. Needs to add more features in chat. Needs to resolve and fix the bugs....
"Great tool for working remotely with big crowds...but I sometimes have had hard time trying to access to a meeting (I have gotten a ""wrong"" passcode)"
Zoom is best app for video calling, specially for students, bt it has little issue of Timing. it's time limit is not enough for classes. Time limit destroy whole mood of study.i hope it will be better.
"For distance learning can you create an option to move the way screens are displayed so the teacher and the screen they are sharing can be placed next to each other and/or be able to select 2 screens (or more) to show/highlight, similar to speaker view but more of a ""presentation and presenter view."""
Super easy to use this app. I love this. This is not complicated as microsoft teams. I use this to join my school's meetings. But some time it's a little glitchy. That's the only problem. Download this app and start ZOOMING !
When I join first time I can't hear anything and other people can't hear me.
Pretty simple, far as I can see. What isn't seems like common sense mishaps that get fixed quickly every time. Thanks!
This is a very good app but there are infrequent bugs now and then. We have to wait till next update to solve these issues. My network is very fast, that's why I am sure its bugs.
I had lots of very imported meetings on zoom with my family which is all over the world. WE are sorting out family matter which will be impossible to involve everybody if it wasn't for zoom.Thanks to zoom everybody got involved and listen to.And that's thanks to that app.However for the last 2 meetings it would not accept my password. I don't know why.After trying for 30 min.it did but I was late.I like the idea that is simple to install and easy to use.
Great experience most times. There are sometimes where I cannot get into room (one time) and other times I cannot get good reception and won't hear very well and that is at numerous sessions (less than four times perhaps)
Good app but the problem is in laptop and iphone they gave one option that is virtual background but in android device they didn't gave that so at our home it's so difficult to arrange a place where no one come. Plz update that zoom. otherwise its very good
It is wonderful to be in contact with others! It breaks up a bit, but it is much better on zoom than it was on Skype. Thank you for this Zoom service! God bless you!
great way to connect without leaving the house. I am keeping contact with friends and family this way and I also do exercises in the morning show. thanks Zoom for opening new opportunities in difficult times
I did't find recording option? I need to record my lecture as a host? 2ndy if little bite internet singles are weak than this app creating sound problems. Developer need to resolve this problem
Works fine for me, except the little annoyance that, on Android, the app doesn't support outgoing 16:9 resolution like it does on all the other platforms. An update to fix this issue would be nice.
Didn't like the new update. Earlier the audio used to be audible even when we minimised the app or sent it to background which way a good feature, now it's getting muted as and when we do so. Please bring it back.
Very fast. The meetings don't lag much and offerd good features for use in a classroom or a meeting. I would give this 5 stars if they add showing profile pictures of meet members.
I am trying to use zoom meeting in my laptop but when I install it 5 to 6 zoom meetings only I am abled to join. After that when I press the zoom icon it is not opening at all. I tried I uninstalling and install and again but same problem occured. Please rectify this problem ASAP
I wish they'd come up with a more reasonable monthly cost for non-business, personal subscriptions. Especially now. Works great but too expensive... (That's a huge tip on your business model.. Want more revenue? Do it for personal use at $10/month and watch what happens)
All is fine but for Android phone they didn't kepp virtual background when i search in google how to keep virtual background means google say please sign in to see the virtual background option but when i sign in also the option is not came that's why i don't keep 1 star and please update zoom for Android phones also having virtual background option
Great meeting and learning app. Thanks for this. But the data usage is on tbe high side. I wish if the data consumption can be reduced to encourage it
I like This app,But am not sure why when i join a meeting, I can't hear anyone in the meeting.I can only see all who in the meeting,but can't hear anything.
Using zoom on my android phone is great. So pleased because on my Microsoft based computer the video dn work with zoom--though separately, on the computer, the video does work.
Although the app is very easy to use and it's the most useful app nowadays where people can do their meetings very easily but for me the problem is that whenever I am going to participant list my video is getting off so this much problem is there with me I hope zoom will see this problem and help meÃ°Å¸â„¢â€šÃ°Å¸â„¢â€š
It is very good app but one more features you should add that we can zoom the screen that is shared by other participants sometimes the word written in the screen shared by other participants is very small please take it seriously and add this feature
The thing that I Don't rate 5 stars Ã¢Å“Â¨ is that I was enable to sign up from zoom app So I watched vedios from Youtube and found a website of zoom i.e zoom. us from which i was able to sing up Plz fix the problem And In other word it is a good app
Works best with broadband of course...not so bad with a good signal. I use it multiple times daily. Free is always nice too!
This app is good for online classes as I have experienced....only the chat box is a problem for kids...but the hosts are given the right to disable it...Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€šoverall it's good
This app works very well, I havent had any problems yet I only gave it 4 stars because I prefer the laptop version over the one on this tablet because it had more viewing options
Good app,I liked it so much it hasa nice features in it but it has lot of issues such as network problem, bluur voice and bluur photos etc..... So I am giving it 4 four star app is good but need improvement in it.
Nice app , a good video conferencing app , one of the best , easy to use but should remove 40 minutes time limit in free version which makes it a bit uncomfortable
I gave zoom 4 stars because I can't get virtual background...but In my friends phone it is getting......both are of us are using Android......if I get virtual background then I will give zoom five stars !
It's really a very lovely application and there is enough clarity, visibility and it's audible as well. Thanks.
Very very nice app for students and teachers in this lockdown Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Âbut something should be improved.& that is if video is shown & we see participants the video's voice is not coming .So only 4 stars Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š
This app is very useful to students and teachers. But the problem is that the sharing option in the meeting is not at all working after the last update. This creates a problem for teachers as well as students. I request the developers to check the issue.
This app good for listening online classes but only thing is when signal decrease the video getting reconnecting and the video is very poor quality, I expect the next update will improve the app...
Overall the zoom is best for meeting but during meeting when I turn on my video I see myself but other participants are not able to see my videoand in participants its showing off and please make the virtual background in phone Ã°Å¸â€œÂ±.
A very good platform to conduct meetings and classes during lockdown period. But please add polling feature at a good level as it becomes necessary to hold polls during meetings.
Very useful app, with latest features...Great app ever...but I reduced 1 starÃ°Å¸Å’Å¸ because the video always switches off, whenever we go to the participant list...Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€
As a teacher this is a great app BUT the thing is that the kids can do backgrounds and I personally don't think they should have the ability to do that please fix it BUT over all everything else is good Ã°Å¸â€˜Â Ã°Å¸ËœÂ
Its a very nice app were we can conduct meeting ,its helpful in this pandamic situation. But sometimes its vedio and audio will be not clear. I rate 5 stars for this app
Very good app for learning Ã°Å¸â€˜Â. But there is a technical problem is when I start my video it's not showing in participants. Please rectify it.
Yes now this app is very good but 4 stars only because some some times the sounds are not coming so I have given 4 stars only but ha now also some times the sound are not coming . THANK YOU
I like this app very much because it is very awesome app when i can see everyone through it class teachers students all but only one problem is there that is when i want to attempt class through this app i want so many net connections want and in rainy issues my net loseso that is my only problem for this appÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€žÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€žÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€ž
Sometimes, links to meeting are unclear, sometimes links do not work, but zoom HAS helped us all to connect with each other throughout this difficult.
I like Zoom on mobile. I really want the changing-yourself beta thing that changes the outline of the camera and adds objects on your face. Just put it when you guys are finished with the beta.
Heyy everyone..Being a student, I recommend ZOOM MEETING APP for your online classes. It has so many features on it. I will also trust it's privacy and security. In my Android version it has less features compared to my desktop. Please update ZOOM as per the app needs updated version.Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
It is a very useful app to study,and utsome app,iam satisfied with this app,but there is a little bit of prblm when we r in meeting ,suddenly it's stops work
If it wasn't for the pandemic I would never have found Zoom! I've had no problems with my connection for weeks now. No more dropping off for 5-10 seconds. Thanks Zoom!
The only problem I have is that there would be a random white box that would show up during my zoom meetings or during class and it would kick me out. It seriously gets really annoying. Plz fix it.
Very nice app! But I have one issue with the zoom app... can you please tell me whether we assign people to breakout rooms in an *iPad* ....? That's the only thing I want since I don't have a laptop... pls make breakout rooms in ipads also
Great app, but no longer need it. I would reinstall if the free app gave 60 minutes instead of 40 minutes.
the actual problem is...only 100 people can join...please at least create space for 300 people at a time for free. And meeting link connection issues. And also we need real time caption feature.
I loved this app. Wonderful graphics, wonderful functions. I can say that it is a app to which one should MUST TRY. Loved it.
I could had rate 5 star but the thing is when I join the meeting some times it takes a lot of time and mostly it gets disconnected when I am in the meeting...
In my laptop there is no bell button can you tell me why .The chat box doesnot have a cross button first there was a cross button but not now . I like the the zoom app but please give the bell button in laptop
Easy to use. Easy to start. Settings are mostly easy to find. Just, please have background filters for Mobile.
This app is the best meeting app I used. It's very easy to use. Simple UI. I always using this app for my works. This app is really good.
I want this app to be updated. If we go to gallery view we should have many emojis to use if we on the video in a corner (left up corner) if we don't on the video also we have this availablity. Now which are there are Ã°Å¸â€˜â€¹Ã°Å¸ÂÂ»,Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ»,Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¯Â¸Â,Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€š,Ã°Å¸ËœÂ² and Ã°Å¸Å½â€°. I want more please Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­ After I updated this app also I am not leaving the meeting Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜ and I am coming out of the meeting this is the reason I kept 4 Star Ã¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­Â please update it Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­Ã°Å¸ËœÂ­ Or else it is the best app
I insist you to pls add caption option like in google meet. Only in this option google meet is ahead of you otherwise it is an outstanding app. It is a lifeline in last months.
I love this app but i gave it four stars because it requires very high speed internet. It should be able to run on low network
It works. Need to experiment to learn how to setup recurring meetings. Then it works. Have hosted small meetings from my android tablet.
Until today it was a excellent app. I used it to chat with my friends but today my wifi is full but still its showing unstable wifi and also not showing me my chats .....hope it recovers
Good app for studying but I am facing unmute problem nowadays when I enter in The meeting I listen the voice of every one one the meeting but they can't listen my voice because I can't unmute it.
Great app use it all the time but cannot stream to Facebook. My settings have stream to Facebook and YouTube set on but when in my meeting there is only an option to stream to YouTube, no option to stream to Facebook.
Hey overall great app but I have got only one problem in a meeting or a class my video is like stretched or widened and its makes me look more fat than I usually am and in other apps the camera is working fine.Any solutions for this stretched video please?
My problem is the video quality. The video quality is very low. And this should be improved
I have a small glich, When anyone calls me it will automatically decline the call even when I dont do it. Please fix this bug it gets terribly annoying. Especially when school starts and the calls dont work. Please fix this.
I dont know why but this app keeps stopping again and again whenever i am trying to join any meeting And ive installed it almost 5-6 times already after uninstalling to see if it still works but the sameÃ°Å¸â„¢â€šÃ°Å¸â„¢â€šÃ°Å¸â„¢â€š
NiceÃ°Å¸Â¤â€”meeting app but some problem found that's why I gave 4 stars.These problems are that it take so much battery and net problem.And when we go on chat our video is automatically off.Ã°Å¸ËœÂ£
Have tried joining several meetings and it comes back with invalid meeting password. its little annoying
It works properly . But sometimes it will get disconnected and the metting s password will show wrong The app is very good it is easy for online class for students Ã¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸Â
It's a good app but on my phone (huawei p30 lite) when I'm screensharing I can't share the audio while my friend can, also it's laggy when you share your screen
"4 star rating because I can't sign up for the zoom it says ""you can't sign up at this time"" If someone could fix this problem I would change my rating"
Omg why does the camera in zoom looks like a android camera 6 years ago but overall this is a good app and the controls are easy but I give 4 stars because of the camera
Should be a way to save meeting for subsequent use and other obvious UI ease of use, internet pauses/stops out as with other apps so lose audio which is primary comm method
You know this app is really good in this time for us but I give it fours stars because it's happening to me and to all my frnds I can't put a virtual background over me while attending meetings
Everything is okay but sometimes the audio cuts down Ã°Å¸ËœÂ.Need to improve the audio quality and add some new features .
Works most of the time. Quality is better than Skype, but when WiFi is bad it will glitch or leave and reconnect.
Even I would give 4 stars only as virtual background feature is not supported in Android tabs or mobiles. But all Apple devices have compatibility with this feature
Excellent Video Meeting Technology. Simple to use. Clear visual & audio. Screen sharing is a game changer.
Yea it's a great problem . Our video is on but it shows in participants off and if we back our video doesn't mirror it seems stop to others . This is a great problem please solve it as soon as possible
This app timing is not good. When my school meeting was going on and in the main timing the class ended. It shows THANKS FOR CHOOSING ZOOM. FREE CLASS HAS BEEN ENDED
Reliable and dependable application. I enjoy the opportunity to view presentations and host meetings and events.
i an give this app 5 star but there is a problem by creators.hosting of a meeting should be eligible for any age , so pls creators give a change in this i want to make a meeting room with my friends but not eligible age. creators pls change this. and others things are working well and working very fast but overall statistics is very high what can i do to solve this? my age is 15 and i want to create and host a room with my friends pls make all age eligible for hosting meeting pls pls pls i know
Its very difficult because of connecting audio always when starting the meeting
Great app but a problem is that only hosts can share the screen but the other persons can't so,please make this setting in the another version otherwise no complaints Ã°Å¸â€˜Â.
I give it 4 star Ã¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­Â becauz every thing in this is good. But there is no option of virtual background.i need virtual background in android. Fix it zoom plz
It is an nice app for online classes. I gave it 4 stars because in android it doesn't support virtual background. So please add that feature (android virtual background).
I wants to give 5 stars but it not that much better its connections are going,and showing video off in participants and not coming voice properly.....but than also it is best for this type of time...
Very helpful app in brining people each other, though with things still to improve but stoods out from the rest as to usability. Thanks Zoom!
Before updating the latest version, I was too much happy with my zoom.But after updating this version, It gets sloww for preparing meeting and connecting.Please solve this kindly.I love it
"Excellent tool. Waiting and hoping to have the ""Raise hand"" available alongside the audio and video buttons."
It is a good app for online classes .But it would have been better if they leave the participants to record the session as host MY REQUEST IS TO LET THE PARTICIPANTS TO RECORD THE SESSIONS.....
Solid, positive experience..but there should be the ability to utilize virtual backgrounds via an Android cell phone.
Can u put few more editings in virtual background for android users expect this every thing is good and try to give all android users the better experience like the users of laptop and tabs if all these are there zoom could go out more interesting
Nice app, and it is very useful for my sister and father for cloud meeting but there are some problems in it fix it that it would easy for us to... Anyway it is useful for study and any other works etc. I gave 4 star s because everything is good but there is only one problem that is camera's icon may create some problems in it fix it that it would easy for us to...
This is very easy to use and amazing....but thats what the problem with me my teachers are forcing me to attend the meeting...pls don't update any bugs let them be there...thats the savior for students like me..
This app helps me to do my online classes but the only thing is we cannot record audio without hosts permission .That it is why I am rating it 4 stars.
When I am in middle of a meeting it diconnects and the other reason is it doesn't shows virtual background
"I face difficulty in changing my profile photo... whenever I choose a photo it says that ""editing is not supported for this image"""
I can' change my Photo It says Network error as always Even after A week. Its connection is nice the Meeting in this app are crystal clear and not blurry
Hi zoom i am a student i take meetings on zoom daily but i was taking a meeting on a new mobile (Redmi Note 9 Pro Max) There I Seen Virtual Background Then I Took A Old Mobile There Was No Virtual Background So Please Make Enable On Old Mobile Also Thats Why I Gave 4 Stars Please Make This Issue Solve I Will Give 5 Stars Please Please Today Your Update come but there was no virtual background option for old mobile please fix this issue i will give you 5 stars
This is a very good app and I use it for my online classes but whenever I on my camera it shows off in participants list please fix it.
I like app but there is some problems. They are . 1) video is open in meeting but not show in partipation list.2) audio no longer Pls consider this problem because I am student and attendance is important
This app is so good and helpful but a problem occours that if I turn on my video it is shown to me in gallery view and self view but it show my video off in participants While I on it
Very good. Sometimes freezes briefly. I find it a bit confusing to have my audio on but video off.
This app is awesome after lockdown our online classes is being in zoom. This app is awesome I would give it 4 stars because it lags to much.
Very few problems. Works best if you close other apps running in the background and clear junk from memory.
Best app for meeting so far in this pandemic situations.. however the problem is the limited time just only 40 minutes per meeting except for teachers
Very good to do video calls meetings but I don't know this time I got a new phone Vivo 19 and am not able to share my screen on even when I am hosting a meeting it's not a good sign for zoom call. Please resolve asap. Thanks kishor
Thanks for the app because it helps me to attend online classes and teach my students and for your app and I have sometime it is not good working I think you will be able to solve this problem
It's a nice app but only one issue that it shares sound only thru laptops not from phone so please fix it, otherwise it's a good app.
This best for meeting, chatting etc. But if anyone pin our then we see how many people pin us and the name of the person. Please add this feature for a little protection of a user.
Very nice app but I have one issue about zoom cloud meeting because of host setting because of that one star and for the students why there is no like host settings
I have found Zoom, a good platform of communication with friends and family, and members of social get together, at this time. Thanks Zoom.
Well everything in zoom works well but I wanted only thing that is I need the option to delete or edit an message in the chat in the meetings.
Service is reliable. Easy to use. Audio is getting better. Navigation getting better. Video getting better.
Only 4 stars because I'm old and have gotten the flow of the system yet. I see a 5 star review in the future after my kids educate me more on this here infernal technology.
Zoom is a helpful medium to have in this time of the pandemic. It helps me to stay connected to my children in the classroom
Directions to use tu his app would be helpful but it doesn't take too long to figure it out. TEST using it before an important meeting so you don't fumble around.
Although i still have not seen the virtual bsckground option they claim android is available, the rest of the festures have been good.
I Iike this app even if its really unlikely to replace personal contact its got useful features like sharing screen and does allow everyone to keep in touch but wow you know when you been zooming
I have been able to use Zoom for exercise classes and being a senior , I am isolated from doing things face to face with other seniors, so, having Zoom, it makes me feel great. I can still exercise with them. without leaving my home.
Good but sometimes it disconnect automatically that's why I have lost some of the important meetings . Kindly improve this bug .
Important, but never been the most stabile. Added new features for the pandemic may have made certain types of meetings harder.
This app is too good... But in mobile the video quality is too bad & When I connect laptop from my meeting in the meeting the video quality is too good.... So plz solve this problm... plz improve the video quality I'm mobile... Plzzz plzzz plzzz..
Amazing app! Only one problem... It always shows video off in participants list... Please fix this.
Maybe it will be more useful and helpful if zoom provides digital/online whiteboard, so teachers can easily explain the materials
Sometimes its difficult to connect. I am facing a lot of problems during the meeting. It disconnects frequently.
the application is very good. due to current scenario we are using zoom meeting app for online class,vbut being a student, sometime s miss class due network issue etc .,. i request for q record function for user to record class with audio . i hop you will consider this request and do the needful
The app is good but wish it was formatted for tablet so can see chat to the side in real time, so can scroll up and down
The auto connect to the audio is not working in the app. Its little annoying
Fun to see everyone in class and at home, at the same time. Love the mute mic button. Lol.
i like using this zoom meeting because it can do so many thing such as sign up to be a host or sign in, choose virtual background and a lot of that i needed but can you please add vortual background for LG Taplet?
I liked this app much and my problem is also solved by you but the app can be more better if there is an option of captons.
Good app but i need that it should directly connect using link only and its mÃƒÂ¨eting time should be extand to 1 hour and it should allow more than 100 people
I think their should be a recording option in the smart Ã°Å¸â€œÂ± phone meetings,I would like to say that it is a very good app Ã°Å¸â€˜Â Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬ If possible please make that little change. Thank you Ã°Å¸ËœÅ 
In Zoom meeting video recording is not available but in google meet have video recording only one problem faced . But it is good
Actually the main problem is that there is no recording option on mobile it is available in laptop or computer but not in mobiles so please update it for recording option
I am strugling to add virtual background on zoom laptop. The option not avaiable.
Very good app no ads and very easy to use and th app will be better if there is option for copy the text in share .
Some sound issues with different devices, but overall works well to stay connected over during the pandemic.
This is very good app for conference but if the meeting could be unlimited then it would be more easier.
Only lasts 40min on average. Then have to restart the meeting and/or call and its annoying
So amazing app but some network problem are disturb our meeting Only host can start the meet and our kids to school meet hanging with out video is mirror always
Zoom is really helpful and clear to use.
This app is awesome but every time my video is on in participants it always shows to me it is off please solve this problem as soon as possible
This app are very useful We can still connected to our love one's All over the world. my issue in this app my audio is not available on share screen
Best app ever! But there are some glitches and bugs. Plz fix this. The meetings are great!
Please add the function that the earphone button can mute and unmute the mic And also add function of using ultrawide lens so the devices with UW lens can get more view
It is very good app but it has to improve its settings and controls in ios and android. It is a great app in Ã°Å¸â€“Â¥.
Good for meeting' ,gatherings. Heating problems when using in mobile. Also Error & disconnecting issue
I like Microsoft teams more zoom I share it more than zoom but I like zoom has a little problems to fix only a little problems which can make this app really terrible
No problem a good app only one problem is that we can't do virtual back ground so please check that and update me pleasee.
This app is amazing and its too good but if there was virtual background on mobile also then i woupd have given 5 stars but please add that feature.
When I put it on I open a camera and I go into another app at the same time it turns off the camera on my own and in addition to that I go in to see who goes into zoom it turns me off its frustating
Good but Zoom cloud Has not clearity in live meeting. If we have not perfect network we cannot join meeting if joined we cannot listen voice perfectly.
Experience was great I can attend all of my classes without any prblm.... And thanks a lot for keeping the time limit though it doesn't benifit me bcz we have to rejoin again but still I wanted to be unecessarily sarcastic so yeah Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€š..... Just kidding the app is great... Thank you Ã°Å¸ËœÂ
It is better than Skype (sound and video), but lack the chat history for later reference as Skype.
It is best app in the world Ã°Å¸â€˜Â¨Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ°Å¸â€™Â»Ã°Å¸Â¤â€” but it have some problems like network some have updated come first some not.
Google meet is better than this app. There are lot of problems which are have to be faced between the meeting.
I am facing problems in turning on video , I turned on my video but it's showing yet the video was not opened. Pls rectify it. I either tried others phones also or complained also u didn't getting us clarifired.
I like it just that i wish it could also be offline because when theres no WiFi i usw all my data so please adjust it, overall its a good app.Ã¢ËœÂºÃ°Å¸â€˜Â
Happy to have the zoom app to connect all meets during this pandemic season.. But stil have to be cleared audio problems
Network problem are their In some time and video might be blur ...... but in this pandemic time of corona ...... this app is soo helpful for us ......
It is a nice app but the feature of putting virtual background is not there in Android. Please add that feature.
Nice app, I liked it's video quality. Just a suggestion do something to record my meeting when I am not the host
This meeting app is really fantastic. Actually, I'm using this and it's gives good service.
Great app, easy to use remembers previous meetings username and makes it to connect with others.
Excellent ... depending upon network connection its the flawless experience ... i m using it in Samsung galaxy grand prime
There will 5 stars from me but there is problem in the newest version when i want to open my video the video is on but in paticiptants it's showing that my video is off so please please solve this problem. if problem will be solved i will edit my riveveiw
Whenever I switch on my video it doesn't show in the participant list(it shows my video is off) Pls solve this problem. it's becoming a problem for me.
This is the best app ever! It has so many nice features. But, I reduced a star because of one reason. Whenever I keep my video on and then switch to the participants list, it shows that my video is off..this is after a recent update..(before the most recent update). Pls fix this problem because it creates confusion and inconvenience. Rest all is the best, as i said before. The best audio-visual quality and other features of screen sharing, chat and all. Thankyou.
Good job.. There is no any problem in this app... We can take classes very easily on it. So I say to everyone install this app if you are student and if you wants to take the classes in home I mean online class so first of all install this app to take classes ThankÃ°Å¸â€™ÂÃ°Å¸â€™ÂÃ°Å¸â€™ÂÃ°Å¸â€™â€“Ã°Å¸â€™â€“Ã°Å¸â€™â€“Ã°Å¸Å’Â¹Ã°Å¸Å’Â¹Ã°Å¸Å’Â¹Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’
I am not giving one star because it is take-ing so much of net and charging.
I don't know, every meeting is limited to 40 min, I tried to upgrade but I can't find where, aside from that, everything is satisfactory. Thank you
Its good app for online classes.But I suggest you to keep options menu (mute or unmute,video,participants,more)lock.
The app is excellent but it maybe not optimized for all Android devices. I USE tab A7 and it lags a bit.
Last update was really mind blowing.......it is far better than Google meet......I really appreciated with this app for online meeting s
Well in phone and tab there is no record option. So I did not like that. Only 4 stars.
Its a good app but when i try to say so anything to someone the mike doesnt respond and as much loud i can say y voice does'nt go to others, plz fix Ã¢ËœÂº
My device is not eligible to use virtual background. :( My device is Oreo, Android 8.0 Why is my device still not compatible? :(
Recent meeting id is showing in the latest update . Please fix it as soon as possible
I was a good app but some where i found that when the network connection is good it still make you leave the meeting
Nice and no advertisements. Could have been better in terms of Screen sharing frame rates but overall a nice app.
Though the features of zoom is really awesome. I am unhappy to give it 4 stars due to the same video issue. Many people are facing the same problem like me I guess. When my video is on and I go to the participants list, it shows that my video is off. Even the other people cant see my video. That creates a great problem to me during online classes. Please find out a solution to solve this problem. I hope the next updates will make me rate zoom 5 starts.
It is Good. But when I download it everything was fine but afterwards I found an issue. When I on my video, in participants they show that my video is off. This problem should be solved. Only this is the problem remaining are Ok. So, I will give it only 4 stars Ã¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­ÂÃ¢Â­Â if you can solve this problem I can give it five stars !
It beats a blank. Who knew that during a pandemic this would be the go-to for communication? 11-26-20: I just wanted to add thank you to the developers of this communication source and Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ¾Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ¾
The app was ok and best BUT AFTER UPDATE IT HAD SOME BUGS AND LAG ISSUES PLEASE SOLVE THEM THANK zoom(zoom). WAS BEST FOR MEETINGS
It's a really useful app, during this period especially. It's helping us to keep up the communication with friends&family. I'm using it for my Online Classes. There's one issue that, whenever my network crashes in the middle of the class, I'm losing at least a minimul part of my attending lecture. Technically, it's not the problem of the app, but if the developers could create an option so that i could get back what I lost regarding network crash, that would have been a serious helping hand.
Generally works very well and has lots of good features, though they're not always intuitive to use.
This conferencing app is very good , but sometimes I often see that my profile got hidden that's why i rated 4 stars but except that all is fine
When i launch it it doesn't open. Saying this app cant be opened i dont know if it is low android version
When I mute a meeting only the sound source on my phone changes from media-speaker to call-speaker. And then the screen goes black randomly a lot of times in middle of using phone. Also there isn't a provision of muting a meeting while connected to headphones.
Would be better if we could use the chat or the meeting settings while looking at the main screen, like in the Desktop version. And, for the desktop version itself, when I change the orientation of my laptop for the shared screen to look big (shared screen is a mobile phone's portrait mode whiteboard), the orientation of my video doesn't change. It looks like I am sitting on the wall or on the ceiling. This is a important feature that should be implemented. Zooming into a video or shared screen should also be available for online classes to be able to see all the details on the board, or in a shared OneNote, etc... As few online classes (like the ones I attend) only allow people with a particular zoom account given by the school, I would like to be able to record the classes to review them or to send them to an absent classmate. This would be extremely helpful. Other than these, a great app.
Good App for Video Confrencing But It Has Some Network Problem Please Fix It as This App is good For Computer As I can See All the People In gallery Mode
All is well But Record option is not available in android device . Please look at this query, otherwise its good
This app is good but when you are living long your voice is not clear.
Good easy use but one problem not taking gmail and needed to create new one it's very bad of this and all others r good
Easy to use. Useful for teaching, and presentation,
Everything is fine with zoom only the thing is if you give all devises to allow virtual baground then it will be fine
Nice app. But it has some problems. Like disconnecting and not getting the voice , and not getting visible screen. So I'would like to rate this app 4 stars. Please try to solve this issues . And if you are thinking I might have network problem, I have checked my network connection it is good but, the app is not responding . Please try to solve this issues. please read this letter and solve this issue. THANK YOU....
Zoom has become a way of life during the 2020 Pandemic. It connects families, coworkers, students &teachers, and new friends around the world. It could be improved by having more technical assistance. I personally had some major problems with audio and unresponsive screens and was not able to connect to anyone who could assist me, answer my questions or give feedback if others had experienced the same problem.
It is a nice app..BUT I have a doubt that how to do virtual background.. So I gave 4 stars.
I gave this four starts cause it an useful app but whenever I click of share nothing happens and I think this is happening in my device only so if zoom can do something so pls do it.
Op app i wanted give it five stars but because our network connection i no too fast so sometimes the voice of our teacher breaks nd otherwise it is is a very nice app for meeting in lockdown Ã°Å¸ËœÂÃ°Å¸ËœÂ
It worked but it will not let me sign up and I need to do zoom so yay it good but needs to be fixed
All good..... Especially for my online classes Ã°Å¸ËœÆ’ Loved it !!! But would give 4 stars due to some problems.
All is right but it has some network connectivity prob. But app is v. Good .Connectivity is exeption
Overall experience is amazing! But there are some issues Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€ The app should have delete option in chat, we can't delete our sended messages! The message lasts for the whole meeting/lecture. Only i have complaint about this issue Rest all thing is Good...!
I am giving four star because when zoom is going then we are somthing apps are opening why video was automatically off why?
My experience in zoom is so fantastic.Here I can speak comfortably and also I can chat with my friends and teachers.I used many apps but it was really a new kind of app for me.In this disaster, everything has stopped. The corona virus were harming our education badly. But by this app we can study as regular.But i can't save my photo in the app. Thank you for representig such a useful app.
I like it it is usefull for teacher and student also since corona virus most of company use it but I cannot use any app over the meeting like sharing my screen or plain online with friend please try to fix this problem
This is very excellent app for meeting , but it takes lots of data.
Used to open zoom on my pixel. Was fine. Then moved to laptop. Use zoom 6 days in a week for teaching. Is fine too. This morning, tried to open zoom on my pixel again. 1st time using it after upgrading to android 11. Was absolutely nightmare. My video was black. The back camera was fine. Tried the front camera on other apps. Works well. Zoom's video NOT COMPATIBLE with android 11. Ckckck... This evening, just updated. U fixed it. Well done! 4 * waiting for ability to share more than 1 screen Ã°Å¸ËœÂ
A really good app to use. I used this app during lockdown and it was really great. Unfortunately there is one small problem . Recently, about 2/3 through the Zoom call, it disconnects and it's really annoying. But after you connect again, it's totally fine for the rest of the call. Overall amazing app. Definitely recommend.
I have not giving one star because whenever I start the meeting it continuously showing that connecting for half hour or one hour
Overall, its a nice app. But one feature which must be added in privacy settings. That is the host can mute some selected participants permanently for 40 minutes. This feature can be very useful in case of some fraud people coming with fraud names irrespective of the waiting room.
My experience I had was fantastic,quality was really good and simple to use
It is a good app but a problem is there the link share by the host to the consultant person after that the person is sharing the link with unwanted person and he is use bad language in the meeting . Thier should be a unique link or password for 1 person suppose there are 60 person so there should 60 password for each person . This helps to know who is sharing link or password . Please solve this problem I hope you will understand this problem
It is a good and a very nice app to do your classes there are glitches of reconnecting please fix them Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€ž
It's good and the graphics are good and it's not like glitch all the time sometimes it's glitchy
It is very nice app but sometimes it has many network problem but it is very nice app Ã°Å¸ËœÅ  I will gave it 4
Is amazing! you developers are doing fantastic work, my spotlighting issue is solved, thanks so much!, what I want you guys to solve for me now is:virtual background , please, bring update that will support my android version and device, my android version is 7.0, my device is techno tablet ,droipad 7 D , techno 701, 1GB RAM. I don't have any option to enable virtual background during my meeting, please fix that problem, thanks so much!.
In general, it is wonderful. But why you restrict to 20 occurrences! We have to reset again and again. In our zoom, background view is not all working. With some people it is working
Thought this would be a pain in the butt I would use for work until I didn't use it anymore but it has been more and more consistent and had more features for work and personal use since July. I do wish it was easier to renew a recurring meeting but I love the options for calendar invites, email invites, and texts. And the security features.
Iam gonna give zoom 4 stars because there is no virtual background for all devices please add virtual background for all devices.
It is connecting to audio automatically I changed in setting to automatically call over internet when the meeting starts I should do connecting call automatically
Amazing app...We just need some new features in this app. Nd it will be fantabulousÃ°Å¸â€™â€¢Really loved this app Ã°Å¸Ëœâ„¢Was giving 5 stars but edited becoz we want some new features like Ã¢â‚¬Â¢without internet it is working....Ã¢â‚¬Â¢In chat box we r able to send photos nd some more things...Please Ã°Å¸â„¢â€ž
Almost this app is very useful and gives speedy performance. Specially, for students who are attending online classes. I recommended a feature of this app ---- --By using this feature you can hear clear and loud sound of anyone in you meeting. You have to do is ----Open Zoom ----Open setting on left corner ---Scrool down until you find original sound ---Swith on the toogle And then whenever you will join meeting Just enable it -- Click on three line --Click Enable Original Sound. Then, hear
Please remove voice issue from this , sometimes my voice is not audible to the host while speaking
Plz make a low network mode in which we can only hear the sound because some people are having high network problems...
I mean this a review for laptop version. In the latest update, I was able to move videos! Which I thought was amazing but I am not able to move when someone has their hand raised I don't know why?! But overall I have a Ryzen processor and I can't use background w/o a green screen! But overall even the beta is good not the official features though Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¢ hope they fix it soon. And when I go out of the meet to see my MSG's, the video is turning off! Think this is a bug
Good app, you can do as much as you can on a PC it is just a little more fiddly
I just finished my first Zoom call, ever! (No judging) It worked out pretty well. Personally, I wish I could see everyone all on one screen, instead of having to scroll left to see the rest of the people on the call. It's not a huge thing. And other than that there were no issues. Thank you for making these video meetings even possible! It's a HUGE breakthrough and, because of the pandemic, became an absolute necessity. Thanks again!
This is a VERY NICE app Ã°Å¸â€˜Â and very helpfull also ! Now adays all the world is using this app ! Nice keep it up! But only one thing I had problem in And that is :there should be an option of change profile photo In logout zoom
Really enjoy using this app, however, after the last update, both my daughter's and my new ACER Chromebook's started freezing and shudder glitching when we first start a meeting zoom or go into break rooms. Didn't start until the last update. 11/16/20. Please look into this. Thank you! cjs
Not the easiest UI. But it has the best video quality for groups of more than 2
Why I am giving 4 stars reason is there are so many glitches like start video when we start video in praticpants list it will show video is stopped
V.nyc..but sometimes the picture quality is not good and also sometimes it show an unknown error occured. Pls. Try to improve it and a good thing about it . It doesn't show ads ...that's a really NYC point and it is also easy to use but if this app offline...I will surely give 5 stars. Improve your mistakes and get 5 stars. The main problem is it use data network. Which is not a good point Ã°Å¸ËœÅ and 1 more main problem that I am not able to do screen share. .pls. try to improve Ã°Å¸ËœÂÃ°Å¸ËœÂ
After my last review, zoom has indeed worked on it! But this time, the problem I got is the new feature according to which perhaps if we go back with meet going on, then our camera will automatically show off to others but if we are on zoom then it will show on! It troubles me during exams cuz I receive Q paper on same phone and we have to keep video on! So, if I go see Questions, then it will turn off my camera! Bad thing!
Great app. I just wish Hosts and co-hosts can raise and lower hands as well. Why take that function away? Not every meeting is handled the same way as others. Sometimes there are multiple co-hosts on a meeting handling different functions. I hope the developers see this and consider making those small changes. Thanks.
Because of Corona Virus (Covid-19) everything was closed including schools and colleges also. Then every school and colleges were taking online classes. And most of the schools were taking on zoom. It was an interesting app, we can do chatting, talking, video chatting, Sharing screen and ect. I liked it very much. Thank you Zoom for becoming our class
It is a great app for calling and tuitions But if you try to change the password for the meeting ,it changes for all meetings and then it is quite difficult to reset and do all steps to reset the password . I really want zoom to have a feature to change the password for one meeting only . Otherwise it the best app to choose for calling and chatting ,etc .
This app is very useful. Yeah but sometimes there are network issues coming.
My video is on from my side and everyone can see it but in the participants list, it shows that my video is off. It is very much frustrating. Request zoom to look into this matter and come up with a solution as soon as possible. This is the biggest problem but everything else is fine. This problem began yesterday. Before that, every meeting was going on smoothly
Super app but give a option to keep virtual background when we on our video otherwise this app is awesome
Good app for online meetings nd classes.The only problem is that when i join a meeting and on my video ,it shows my video is off in the participants list.pls check this out.
I am a young student who had never heard of ZOOM before Covid19 and I feel the software is great and helpful for students like me & especially for the teachers. It efficiently enables virtual meetings. Teachers can share their screens, show wonderful videos, share polls and quizzes. The annotation tool helps them to explain a particular chapter that we didn't understand. But I have an issue sometimes in between my classes because of the connectivity issues. Otherwise it is a great software.
"I loved the app very much. I want to rate it 5 star if i get a feature. It is not only my demand. The demand is to Add a ""Recorder feature for free users"" So that we, the students of all over the world, can record our zoom meetings with audio+Video. In this Covid-19 situation we really need this feature as our Online classes are running using zoom."
I played around with Zoom app. & learned, you can use your own virtual background Ã°Å¸ËœÂ! That makes this Zoom app more funer! Take a pic of your favorite place, or the planets, put it on virtual background & it looks like you're at that place. So I give it 4 stars. Ã°Å¸ËœÂ
At first it was smooth enough but later on the app started disconnecting and connecting during the classes. Please look into the matter as everytime this happens and we lose that much time of the session. Might that time the teacher might be giving an important marking or an information that has to known. All the things get messed up. Not once but atleast 5 times it gets disconnected during one session. Please reply asap Ã°Å¸â„¢Â
I use Zoom 9 out of 10 days. These last few weeks. Zoom has been at its best. 4 star. Which is actually good. However there are still some small hiccups. Almost no moments are lost Or stuttering. You are doing better and we needed that. Looking forward to greater improvements. I'll be glad to give this reading a fifth star.
Although zoom is very good app for these school meetings but the only defect I found here is that it needs a strong WI-FI . So I did like this but if you need this you need the strong wi-fi or data pack . And on more thing that there are no such features for phone attendees therefore there are many kinds of features for those who attend with laptop and computer I attend with laptop.
Good app for me and my way of doing things. I haven't used it since downloading the new update, but I would believe if there are any issues with it. The developers are already working out the bugs and would be sending out a new update immediately. So for all of you that give the app 1 or 2 stars because the newest version isn't working to your standards(CHILL OUT). And give them a break because they are also in this PANDEMIC with us as well.
it is a good, compact app for almost every online meeting. its size is 105 mb and it doesn't cache anything! the only problem i have is that it heats the phone up significantly which causes the battery to drain at a faster rate. and sometimes, connection drops but that may also be because of my internet connection.
It is very good application for online meeting and class.There is less loss of data .
This is a good app Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸Â¤Â  But still it has some bugsÃ°Å¸Â¦â€” #.It take much time to get into meeting.Ã¢Å’â€º #.Sometimes it gets network error even if we have fast network like 500 kb/s-1 mb/s .Ã¢Å¡Â¡ #.The videoÃ¢â€“Â¶Ã¯Â¸Â automatically turns off while going to participants list.Ã°Å¸ÂÂ¼ #There are so much of errors so we have to clear cache again and again. Plz Ã°Å¸â„¢Â fix these issues and it will be a better app for online classes Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸ÂThank youÃ°Å¸â€“Â¤
It sometimes take problems... Like report problem.... I prefer everyone to use this app but remember one thing ok you should have a good quality internet connection.... I have written the problem that occur in this app so I am also telling its advantages.... this app has more functions than Google meet it and work more easily than Google meet app... so without thinking much kindly download it if you want video call app..... thankyou zoom for many functions and kindly check that problem I wrote..
It does a great job of making a call, but I noticed that sometimes has less functions at your finger tips on the phone. Or those options are harder to find. Other than that really great app.
Super app and it is use full for our online classes also. I was giving 5 star but there is no virtual background please download virtual background for every android or all mobile phone please this is a request for zoom please set virtual background for all mobile phones but zoom please download virtual background for all mobile phones please this is a request for zoom please set virtual background for all mobile phones please
Good app for online class but cannot connect to audio automatically after meeting starts.
This is best app for online classes and office meeting. It is great for me to do it.
Zoom is leader in communication I accept this. But as a leader it should have that qualities. The new version shows that the video of a person is turned off in participants list. But it is on in the gallery view. And the other thing I want to suggest Zoom is to bring the virtual background option for all android and in new updated versions. Please Take our suggestion as your success.
Works well for me. I like having the ability to put up a virtual background! That's a really great addition. But the hosts of meetings that I attend have issues regularly. Could be user error though.
Nice app Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â But plzz enable virtual background option in all Android devices. If u fix this I'll give five star rating.im waiting for ur update
Nice and good for conference calls but sometimes when I am click to open that it was not coming.
Zoom is the best application I have used but I wish I could get more features from the Laptop version on my tablet especially in the Dex mode
This is a good meeting app. One can easily meet with one another through this app and share his thoughts and ideas with the participants. This app has only one disadvantage that the meetings with 4 or more than 4 people ends after 40 minutes So I request you to please solve that disadvantage . After the new update, I am having many network issues, the host's voice is not coming to me clearly. So I request you to please solve this network problem. Otherwise the app is very good.
(Good when used in PC , need same options for android/los tablets. I use a Samsung tab S6 lite for teaching . And in PC you have a feature called share screen , where you can share work on a particlar app, or a portion of screen . But in android version share screen is just ment to show whole screen which is quite annoying because people the whole process and some time the cocatial of a file in my tab as I insert the file from my device to the app. Pls give Pc share screen feature on Android too
This app is good for meeting . But it will be best if there is an option call virtual background in android. It doesnot support to this. I want this in next update of zoom. I will be great opportunity for us. I am quite happy about this appÃ°Å¸Â¤â€”Ã°Å¸ËœÅ .
Nice app but sometimes it doesn't connect the meeting properly.....but its a good app.....Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
Since October 1st, When I host a meeting in zoom, the share option doesn't get click.... after my software update (vivo rev. 6.12.2)on vivo S1... I don't know If its zoom's bug or my OS bug Other than that everything is good.. Plzzz help me out for my zoom class. This issue has started to occur only after my new OS update, before that everything was working well... Plzz do reply and solve my issues.. else I will make great loss in my zoom class.I can't use whiteboard, share photo etc
Great app... But there should be an option of being able to delete the chats we send to other people. Also there should be a ping to announce that we have a new chat from someone. To check a message we have to stay glued to the screen.
Profile is not changing it showing editing is not supported to this image(not only 1 all images it showing like that) please fix that issue
I would give it a full 5 but I don't like that we can't mute the other so people can hear the host. One of my kids is in kindergarten and even though the teacher mutes all the kids, they are smart and they unmute themselves. This causes my own kid to get distracted, she's one of the younger ones of the class so she's still only 4 which gives her a bit of a disadvantage to begin with but I wish I could mute the other participants myself.
"Thanks for enabeling ""original sound"" on the android version as well!"
Awesome app.. But there is no possibility to remove one or more persons (who are ditrubing d meeting) from meeting perminantly. If we kept them even though in waiting room , new members are not able to join with out unlock waiting room again by host. If host unlocked the waitying room preveious members who are distrubing also can enter the meeting again.. .
Nice but need more improvement in video and audio quality.Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬
It is beautiful platform to learn and also conduct important meeting with security but I will give it only 4 stars as whenever I on my vedio , in the participants list it shows it is off and some of the times my raised hand get stuck and not able to lower it again otherwise this app this amazing and I am using it since last 1 year and never had any issue other than those two mentioned above . I would love this app if those two problems are satisfied and also I will recommend you all to use this.
This a great tool for staying connected when face to face meetings are logistically impossible. Update. I downloaded the update. The video seems to be sharper now. One issue I don't like. It keeps going to a default mode that removes the bottom icon bar. I want the icon bar to remain but it won't let me.
Sometimes the video can hang. Maybe because of the internet signal. I like zoom coz it's clearer than other similar apps, it appears more larger pic size and it can choose not to mirror (which is helpful for me since I have to show how I play the instruments).
I'm grateful for this app it's been very helpful and useful especially at this time of circumstances, with the covid-19 going on is been very useful and I'm happy with it.
I have doubt, that is - When I on my video then , in Participant's screen it will see off to me and all the Participants. Plzz tell how to do it neat...plzÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â. And this is very good app... liked it soooooo muchÃ°Å¸ËœÅ 
I like zoom but before 2 or 3 days it's not working properly it's gonna be trouble to online classes of my son.
"Battery drains really fast, but that's the nature of a live video meeting that lasts for more than an hour. I do wish it would save my meeting passwords. I also wish that features like ""use personal meeting ID"" were better explained in-app so people could take advantage of the full abilities of the software."
I am using your app from almost 5 to 6 months and my experience is very good with your app but nowadays I am facing a critical issue. That is, whenever I switch on the video it gets on in gallery view but it shows off in participants.The thing is that I use your app for educational purpose.I have to on my video in my classes but due to it do not show in participant my miss tell that your video is not on so I am quite frustrated with this thing .Here are some details: Mobile:Mi 7A on Android 10
so far so good. however, i have a little request; Can we have option to change the position of the gallery? currently my laptop (hence camera) need to be setup on left side of my external monitor, but zoom's gallery is always on right side of screen (far away from camera). So when Im looking at teammates while talking, the camera show im looking away(thus seeming rude). If I can set gallery to be on left of my screen instead, then i will be looking into the screen as i speak. Can we, pls?
It's a nice app Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š it works nicely but so I want you to try to fix it . And then zoom is perfect for getting 5 stars. Try to fix it as soon as possible. I hope so you can do it.
It is good the app is helpful very very helpful but I think it will be better if you had caption (subtitles) when you talk it should show in the bottom what we are talking it will be way better because when you can't hear properly or something else like you don't have strong network you could turn on caption (subtitles) so you can add this feature pls on the next update pls bring this caption feature too pls pls pls Also it should support many languages Thank you pls add it l like this app!Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬
Dry good app so far. How about a way we can blur the background instead of using the virtual background?
Id give this a full five stars but I wasn't able to speak on my zoom call on my old phone. Not sure if that's because I had headphones in or what but I tried everything including taking them out and still no one could hear me. I'm having no issues on my moto g now, but I feel that older phones shouldn't be discriminated against.
Interface is quirky. Settings split between App and Website with no obvious logic. Schedular only inegrates with calendars if you set the meeting, invites cannot be imported. Video quality is generally good. Audio does not handle multiple voices/sound sources simultaneously well so forces stilted unnatural interaction. Cannot control individual sound sources, so you are at the mercy of the other participants' settings. You cannot reorder the vid layout nor customise the number on-screen.
I like this app so much... My virtual school, meeting with my grandparents or parties with my friends everything is on this app. But... I would like one more thing too...can you pls give the same amount of option in zoom for different devices? Like i am using tab and my friend is using laptop.... While she has a remount control and security/breakout room option... And I don't Pls update it so every device can have the same options in zoom. Ty for reading
Very good app but still needed some more addition like background image(virtual background) on android mobile .This function will make the app more useful. End to end encryption is for security perpose must be added. It's needed more to provide virtual background in android8 or 9 pie series. Please resolve the solution and provide upto andoid 8 or 9 pie as virtual background.
Well this app is good no doubt .......but if one more feature can be add then it will be amazing . While sharing screen option from mobile .......video can be played but sound is not audible to the participants ......if this can be fix then it could be more helpful to those teachers who teach through mobile .
It's a great tool, thanks. However it took forever to work out all the kinks like no audio etc. Why do I need to unmute myself in the recording button every time I have a meeting?
I think that it is the best app for meetings for more than 50 people. But I don't know if it is a bug or a feature but when you press on participants list our video turns off. Please fix it. And also if you go out of the app during the meeting your video turns off. Other than that it is the best (if you have a good internet connection)
The app is good and quite helping one, but sometimes it consumes a lot of data.
I gave 4 stars and not 5 because I am not able to update it for a long time. Because of it my meeting gets over after sometime automatically. And thus, I have to start it again many a times. Please do something to resolve my problem. But the application is great.Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’
When I minimise my meeting the video is automatically off and then host is shout on me that's wrong...Ã°Å¸Ëœâ„¢in mobile there is no audio setting option that's also wrong. When I see participant list it show my video off,but in actual it is on... Really chey it these are my complaints..if anyone observe this please comment me Ã°Å¸ËœÅ½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’
There should be an option to search within the videos of different participants. PLEASE ADD THIS FEATURE TO GET 5 STARS.
It's a little clunky to navigate until chat and back again. Plus, it is difficult to mute and unmute unless you're on the driving screen... But then you can't see who is on the call. All that said, is super easy to dial into meetings and sound is great.
This app is good but I am facing a problem with the camera no matter how much I try I can't open the camera even though it works in other apps like messenger or Skype PLEASE TRY AND FIX IS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I DO MY ONLINE CLASSES IN YOUR APP SO PLEASE DO TRY!!! NOTE:( THATS WHY I GAVE 4 STAR REVIEW I WILL CHANGE AFTER ITS FIXED)
I wish for a feature where the app allows to scan a QR code to join meetings. Usecase: If i am attending the meeting on my phone and want to switch to my iPad or phone then i may be able to scan the QR code from the joined meeting instead of entering the meeting id and password which would personally make my life simpler. Somewhat like WhatsApp Web....
Great app, sometimes there are issues with connections.
very helpful in this time of pandemic and Quarantine measures are up. It used to be simpler to use but it became complicated now that there's a need to sign in using FB (or other means), thus the 4-star rating instead of 5
Very nice app...it help me and my school to continue our studies during this Corona Period...nice video and audio quality...but I gave 4 stars not because of any network or connecting problem, I gave 4 stars because - 1) There is no option for sharing whiteboard in iOS devices... And 2) You can also add a option for being co-host in meeting...3)You can also add virtual background option in mobile devices it would be nice Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬.... Exept these it's a very Good app for meetings and studies too
If i use split screen (zoom and other apps), it's very likely that my connection will be lost. Also, i don't like the new display and theme. I hope we'll get to change the theme (light or night mode). And i thought it would be good if we can send a message to 'everyone except...'. Overall, it's good.
This is a good application for large members online video call meetings, group meetings or conferences but it has a minor issue if by mistake we leave the class then we have to wait for host to re-enter us. This function was provided in Google meet. So, add this feature.
It will now work seemlessly with all our families devices my only complaint as a mom is not being able to join more then one meeting at once and toggle between the different classes during the distance learning is hard bcuz you can only assist one kiddo at a time while four teachers are all at once running the show on zoom... it would be nice to listen and or watch etc more then one video meeting without being anonymous and not using my login at all. Opening more then one window in incognito.
This app is nice but I didn't give you one star because we can't take virtual back ground on Android
The app generally works fine for lectures, but it's infuriating and embarrassing when it randomly unmutes you in front of the 100+ other participants. Having a simple popup in order to confirm you want to unmute would easily fix the issue. As it stands I constantly need to click the screen to make sure the mute is active cause there is no hood indication of me being unmuted other tgan the chat exploding on me.
It is very good and helful app. I was using this app around 7 months. I did not have any problem. But from one week ago if I on my video and open participants it is coming as my video is off and sometimes it is showing zoom is slow so call and dedect the problem. These are the only problems I am facing with zoom. Thank you.
If i ON the camera icon button in zoom meeting after joining, In bottom of screen . my face is visiable in the screen but when i go to participant list ,it showing my camera is in OFF , this is happened after the last updating on today. Please take immediate action regarding this issue, sir/madam (head of zoom app )
It is a great app but it's just that when I am in a meeting it leaves zoom meeting and stops. But when I am entering it says that there is a problem but when i retry it comes. So please have a look at that and fix it. Thank you.
Great app. Easy way to use. My college online classes are going well in these app.
I like zoom but I gave it 4 star's because some times it doesn't work.
Good and very useful app. But sometimes there are network fluctuation and thus sometimes you can miss some important points but overall good performance in a developing country INDIA!!!
It's quite good to use. And I can attend my classes very easily. But the chatting system is very poor. With due respect, you need to improve the entire chatting system. I hope you would do that and I'm waiting for the next update to fix all the problems.
Awesome app and working good but sometimes it's not coming please solve this issue
Nice. But also can improve your service somewhat. But really good. But if this app is not supported by network, I would be feeling much better than now.
I will give it 5 stars if you add text option in screen share option . The text option is there in zoom but only by Laptops and Computers not for mobile phones and tabs. One more defect is there in zoom that when we are in a meeting by phone in participants our video is off even it is on or off. Please sort out these problems Ã°Å¸â€“â€¢ then I surely give it 5 stars . Thank You
Works like regular zoom, but if you use different names with different groups, they will know. You have to sign on and enter the room, before you are given an option to change it. It needs to come up before entering the room, like the computer program
It's really good for online meetings Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Âbut not coming,if we use for more than three months, even though I updated
It is now a essential app for my online class but still it has some problems to be improved : * Even if my video is on during the class in the participant list it's showing as off. * video clarity should be improved. * dial-in must be little more easier. Please improve the following. And it will be more easy for attending my online class.
I'm satisfied with the app... No adds in between... Good to use search contacts... Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
We use for asl religious services. Works good .Controling your device for use w\ app my problem.
It's a nice app. But i have a problem plz resolve it as soon as possible -> When i switch on the camera and go to the participants lists it shows off and when i go out of the meeting my video for some work it suddenly gets off. Kindly resolve the issue or mail me what to do, otherwise its very good
What on earth was the need of changing zoom? It was fine when we did not close our video and open the participants list and it used to show that our video is open and in the gallery view our video used to freeze but now it is the exact opposite. I just have this complaint rest is brilliant.
After uprade virtual background available I m satisfied very much but the thing is zoom record we can't record with mobile n we can't buy laptop cause of Corina only laptop users can record pls available screen record for zoom
The best alternative to in-person meetings. The system works conveniently and isn't hard to understand. Lots can be accomplished with the ZOOM app, even for your own personal meetings. The only flaw is depending on your internet, the connection can be shaky rendering the app unhelpful.
Very very beautiful app for online meeting dates of the meeting all things are available in.
It's a cool app. it just sucks when ur connection breaks up and ya miss what ppl have said or are saying. But other than that, I like the zoom app. Kinda wish it had more settings though, to change the display and background and stuff like that. But oh well, it's iiight.. !(: Thanks !
When we try to switch to another tab our video turns off . Please rectify it. It is still causing problems
It's nice app but it consumes too much of internet.you should keep megapixel option like 144p,240p,360p.so it will consume less internet.please it's my request to keep this system.thank you for making such a nice app.
A bug that i found in my pc in zoom where i hold to move a video it glitched and i dont have to hold my mouse.
It is good, just that sometimes the meetings crashes. Also the new update...in which the video turns off whilst checking the participants list is not useful, the earlier version in which the screen used to pause was much more useful, please bring that back. Thank you
Best update but there is no virtual background for Android phone Ã°Å¸â€œÂ± users. So why I update also but there is no virtual background option in more or in camera. When I update in participate my video showing off but actually it is on .Why this is happening?????
Everything is good but the virtual background is not coming for me so please set up this problem.
The overall performance of the zoom app is fairÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€ but if a few features are added to this it will be really goodÃ°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸ÂÂ¼ like notification when the meeting that we follow is started it will be really beneficial to students like me, who are waiting in the meeting room for about 5-10Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€˜Ã°Å¸â€¢ÂÃ°Å¸â€¢â€™ minutes this will be beneficial for students, and users please add it in the next update.Ã°Å¸Â¤Â©Ã°Å¸Â¤Â©Ã°Å¸ËœÂ
So far the experience with app has been great with a couple minor hiccups!
This app is nice but if you add one thing it will be wonderful that is you should even put the option background in phone and tablet if you add then it will be wonderful please read this and solve this issue by 20/11/2020 because I need it for my skit I have chosen zoom not teams because zoom is very best then other apps THANKS to read
Its a very good app....., it helped me alot in the pandemic. Due to some settings one of them are. if our video is turned on but in the participants it was showing we are not turned on our video.., thats the problem in this app.., kindly solve my problem, thank you
Rest everyone is fine but u should enable virtual background and please lower the qualifications for applying virtual background without green screen on Macbook pro
This app is totally amazing but the new update is kinda lil' bad which is the reason y I gave it 4 stars. The video and microphone option used to be red when it was turned off and now it's just simply white so if u guys pls bring back that feature it'll be really great, thank you
It is good but add virtual background and video filter should be in mobile or tabs also the voice cracks and sometimes I was not even able to join audio... I think u should look into this matter... And also when I want to remove my profile photo it only asks me to change not to remove... In mobiles when we share screen it automatically turns off our video... It should not do anything automatically...
Very good application for video calling friends, online classes, etc. But I will rate this application as 4/5 stars because when I am in a meeting and if I open participants list my video stops. First it usually pause, but now a days it stops. It's my request to you that please fix this problem...
This app was such a great app. I like this app. This app helps me to do meetings easily.
Zoom is good but it has a few issues since I updated it. Even if my video is on, it will be shown off in the participants section, and it randomly goes on and off. So zoom pls fix these issues and the rest is fine. It's a good app
The absolute best video conferencing platform I've used. Great Audio, graphics. and connection speed. Great for quick impromptu meetings. Not so user friendly in the beginning huge learning curve for a lot of users
It's good app and it works nice but it does not show my video off during the meeting in the participants list even if my video is on
It's great on my laptop, but I use it more on my phone so I would like to see some improvements on the use of microphone on the phone (while I'm looking at my teachers screen, my camera shuts off and mic without me wanting it). In general I think it needs more work on the phone aspect
This app is good for any meeting . I gave 4 stars because it has no share screen option.
This app is very good though but the problem is u cant change ur background while using Android so thats why i gave it 4stars
Overall it is a very good tool. I have noticed that new users struggle a bit as there isn't a tutorial. For some people, that would be very beneficial. My clients could benefit from a tutorial. However, I like this tool and will continue to use it.
Good app. I used to get problems earlier but now hardly I get any of them. But I have marked it 4 stars because the mobile verson dosent have some features such as virtual background, video filter, etc. In computer version I will mark it 5 star.
This app is so useful & important in present situation. But there is no SCREEN LOCK feature.This feature may prevent unintentional Speaker MUTE and VIDEO START. Thus we may prevent weird and embarrassing situation during using zoom meetings for lack of our attention. So add SCREEN LOCK feature specially in ANDROID versions and make it more easy to use.
It would be good that , the mic showing the voice in participants option in green colour up and down ,will show it on main screen in the mute/unmute option. because of this , after unmuting we goes to participants option and check that voice is going. This feature should be added
Great App, but after sometimes i had a issues about turning on the video, when i turn on the video for me it works, but other's did'nt see me, that is the only problem, kindly fix it. If not i could have given it Five star.
This is a good app but it takes lot of network
The app is good. But I think the chat option of the app should be updated.Just like when we chat in zoom, we have to add a photo from gallery sometimes..So plz add a new option in chat so that we can add a photo. Plz fix the problem soon..
Some times it opens slowly but having a good experience The best app for online meetings!
I'm using this app. It's really helpful and nice. But in such updates of this app i am facing the problem of screen rotation in mobile. I would like to suggest that in every update ,screen should be rotational and big.
Needs option to record session and sending private chates to each individual would be nice
Very clear sound, picture and time allowance. Going to arrange a Zoom session with Whanau in Oz this month since no one is traveling. Ã°Å¸ËœÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ§Ã°Å¸Â§Â
i cant hear the sound clearly!!!but its good .it can conduct calls also
This app is pretty useful, but there's a problem when you're in a meeting and your video is on and you click home button then meeting doesn't end but your video turns off, so that's the problem, pls make sure that our video is turn on while we are out of zoom app but meeting still on, so
Great free meeting software. Slightly bothered about privacy implications.
I started using zoom since this 2020 march. The features of zoom are not really good it consumes lot of data. The vedio quality is also not up to the Mark. The recent update is very bad. Though I am using zoom because it very nessary for me to attend classes. So please improve the features of zoom
Well I like this app and it is very helpful it has hd quality video and audio is also super fine but 1 thing that was so annoyed me is I've to update it so many times , it's means update it 3-5 times in a month , if don't update it ofcourse it will beahve mischievous so guys this is good ap but need to update Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¡Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸Â¤Â³
Since I am using zoom from last 6 to 7 months, the new version came in this month has one problem. That is when my video is on it shows off in the participants list. Why? This happening. I request to the company to take action onto this problem and rest all the features are very good
Nice app but Please add Virtual Background option for Android Please I even signed in but it didn't work I am just a student I don't even need a to sign in but for Virtual Background I did please fix this all other features are good I am happy with all features especially reporting by host any unknown can be reported even if he/she left the meeting please add the Option of Virtual Background in Android it's available in Iphone then why not in Android... From a Zoom User..... Plz fix the bug...
Overall great conferencing app. The constant improvements like added 'reactions' icons are welcome. So far, one annoying issue though: when screen sharing on phone, punctuation marks cannot be used in typing text on screen, because the use of these results in stopping screen sharing. Can this please be fixed?
Im having a very good experience of Zoom app n I'm using it since 5 months, I had stopped using all other meeting apps since I started using Zoom app. But all of a sudden, since 2 days I'm facing difficulties while hosting n joining via wifi n d same is working via mobile internet. Moreover, d same wifi is working great wid other apps. I think dis should be resolved soon so Zoom app doesn't lose its users
The new update seems not good,in this update when I minimise it in background of my device, instead of pausing the video icon is turning off.It is very uncomfortable for early users that we can't take any other app by minimising beacuse instead of pausing the video it's icon is turning off.please correct it in next update if possible.THANKYOU
I really had a wonderful experience with zoom It is a nice app for meeting In this Corona time it really help me in my school meeting and other also
App is nice but sometimes I don't do anything and auto matically I get expelled like the teacher will be speaking I will be listening and I won't even touch my device and boom I get expelled and if I try joining again it's like the meeting has nit yeet Started and I ask my friends they will be like the cls is going on..So pls chk that bug and I am not getting how to chat in zoom as u showed in the pics I explored each and everything but I was not able to find so that's the reason I give 4 stars
Been using Zoom on my Android Pixel 2 since March with no problems. With recent update, front camera isn't capturing light. I'm sweating under all the lights I have around me now and still video quality is dark. Hopefully will be fixed very soon
I have rated it four because I want one more feature in it that is we could also unmute and mute ourselves in participants also. And there are some bugs like the screen will rotate even when the auto rotate option is turned off.
Normally works great. Sometimes voice and video out of sync
Its been pretty good so far when it is overcast out side it can be a challenge with reception,other wise not too bad,thankyou
This app is very helpful for me. Though it l can do my online classes very easily. But sometimes l don't know why microphone and camera can't be on.
I have gave 4 stars because the meeting automatically end's after 40 minute. Can you change the duration 40 minute to 1 hour
Although I like the latest updated version of this app it had nice programming but when our video is on and we go to next app or chat box or participants list it seems that our video is off which makes trouble for the people like me who need to use all three options like chat for the answers and attendance from participants lists and opening PDF for the better understanding so .... I hope my problem will be solved
Easy to use, versatile features for presentations & meetings
Zoom app is very intresting in all app, because in lockdown many student use this app for online reading.
It is a very good app for online learning classes for my school my teachers also are using this but one problem I find in this that every time when I use this app it says that in this time it will not be connected for the meeting and I was late many times because of this app only so I am giving it 4 stars so please sort out my problem and update this app for better things in ELT please
Zoom is a very nice app but there is a problem that is I can't share the link in what's app. Please fix it.
Great app. Not quite the same functionality of the desktop version. Main limitation for me being only 4 people can be displayed on the screen rather than 25 on the desktop. I'd say most handsets could display 9 people without losing clarity. Great for out and about calls nonetheless.
Need a feature please. My son seems to think he can just sit there with his camera off and not pay attention to the teacher. Can we get a feature that would allow only the parent to lock his camera on so the teacher can monitor what he's doing? Or if the teacher could lock his camera on would be ok too. Thanks
I like this app a lot especially in this covid as I can meet my friends who I love. I can meet my relatives as well, I can study and its very educational too. Its a nice app but the video should be clearer and it gets stuck in between which I think is not my net problem because we have fats network
Only one thing missing.Ã¢â€”â€ 1. Provide a handle to rotate the objects like line, circle, rectangle etc objects. Ã¢â€”â€  2. It may be better, if you provide alternative combinations also e.g. alt+C and drift mouse or pen to to draw ellipse/ circle. Similarly Alt+l for line,. Alt+ s for rectangle square, alt + a to draw an arc.
Nice app but the reason that it have not given 5 stars is that earlier when you turn your video on or share screen and go to participents list / chat box / minimize zoom it would not turn them off but now they turns off . Otherwise its very good
I'm using this application to participate in online classes. Maybe, This is the best app for online meetings and online Classes. much better than Google meet (Zoom's features) I'm expecting a nice UI. There's something complicated with recording option..
I always get a problem with unmuting but otherwise it is a very good app for meetings and staff
Great app to chat with people live, only thing tHat I would have to say negative, is that it kicks people off the chat and then you have to sign back in which takes time sometimes so you might miss key points in the meeting.
Nice and easy to use and I cannot make meetings in zoom......
Everything is good instead of video connectivity. If ntwrk is slow it disconnect automaticly.
The application itself is great. Good quality of picture and sound. I only get every minute disconnected after I have already used 1.5 GB. I don't have that with oper similar apps.
This app is really good for just hanging around with friend online so that you never feel lonely and its great for university online classes. LIKE IF YOU AGREE Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
All is good except 1 thing. Why is content share options is not there in zoom. i recommend to keep annotate and show names of annotators option. Others are scribbling the picture what teacher is display in the screen so please keep that option. Thank You
The app is really good. But if you can add a new feature I would recommend to add attendance collector. So that it would be easy for teachers. The time when students enter and exit from class.
Very good video conferencing app. That works on low internet speed. I have made more than 30 thousand people to download and use this app for online classes. Also provide them training how to use zoom app for online classes. Can you provide me a certificate for my service towards zoom app.
App is good Just a suggestion, please add video quality feature for meeting participants it would make the app the best...
OK this is super app but sometimes not coming sound
Very nice ,but some sign in problems occur
good one
Excellent Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’
Zoom is very high definition
Works well for my children school but needs do work
Good zoom.
Direct messages Shows to host of metting or not?
How to change background pls tell me
It is nice appÃ°Å¸ËœÂ but the phone getting so hot after using this app
THIS IS A GOOD APP
Good way of learning
Wonderful
Best app ever for students to learn online
Nice experience Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
Overall, this is a good platform for meetings, but there is a glitch, that my video is on in the gallery view when I switch it on, but shows it is off in the participants panel. Please fix. Also add the old feature back, which enables the host to control the video or audio of participants on or off, also allowing only certain participants to unmute only when the host allows it. Adding up to end the review, I'd appreciate adding PC version features to mobile, like virtual backgrounds. 4.5Ã¢Â­Â 4 Ã°Å¸â€œÂ¹:)
Its good but I want virtual background from mobile and it has many glitches please fix them if you can than I can give you 5 stars please fix them
Nice but some time net issue is there thats why i am giving. This app only 4 start
Good but some features are not available in mobile as there in laptop? But like the most than others .
Ok super Ã°Å¸â€™â€¢ but sometimes it is not clear ok na once check out only this all are ok
very nice app nd use to easy
please add an option to save meeting passcodes so that i may give it a five star rating.....
In zoom I can take my class But some time l am not able to put background Piyush Sharma
Only the problem is I dont know how to make a meeting
Not a good app
Absolutely good app
Good app but so many glitches I join my meeting but the glitches stop my meeting please remove glitchs please. And it takes so much net .
There is no loud sound some times and it was stuking so please see this but this app is so good and also please keep anything like some emojis please but this app good for everyone
Generate the option virtual background in Android phone also
No words to say , excellent
I want virtual background in zoom in mobile
It is good but sometimes the other people cannot hear what we are talking so please resolve this problem
Good app video quality is prefet
network issue very bad
Nice but it should be an offline application
The zoom app is nice but they could increase the time limit but it is a really nice app
Whenever I use this app that time it will be a good experience , but when I go to participants or chat box my camera will automatically off and when I go outside again the camera will be automatically off I don't like this feature so I request to the company who has created this app just remove this feature. Thats why I am giving this app 4 stars. Other features are working properly. So please accept my request and this app is goodÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ»Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ»
very good app but stop working sometimes
I love this app but many update
I have to give 4 stars because I actually I want to give 5 starts but starting I don't know how to keep a profile I understood by my own after many months and I kept profile right now and even though why i gave 4 stars because I think that if there is any charging facility it will be more nice not a during meeting after the meeting also we can chat like WhatsApp it will be more nice so i have give only 4 star if my words hurt you i am si sorry
I will give 4 star because that will connecting and disconnecting and voice will break that's why I am giving 4 star
.not that bat it's good app
It lags a lot, and disconnects a lot too, which is annoying but the rest I don't really find much problems
The best app for seeing friends,chating and most of all having meetings.I take my online classes from this app,although there is a problem.Sometimes random people join the meeting.Please fix thisÃ°Å¸â„¢â€¡Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â„¢â€šÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢â€¡Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃ¢â„¢â€šÃ¯Â¸Â
Try to make an ubdate to know that due to error they left the class or withknowing they left the class and it takes more data make it less
It is excellent app. For chat,meeting and video
Can we control the quality of the video? I have 3 class in a day. I can't manage it with my small amount of data please.
Good for met
I give four stars because in zoom class my video is on in gallery and in participants also but in new update in participants show my video is off but in gallery show my video is on i open my video than also is showing in participants my video is off. but its very good app
ZOOM Fairly optimal. Rotate on Zoom switches. Audio is nearly seamless depending on speaker. Picture quality is decent from the PowerPoint perspective.
This app is usefull for online class .
It was amazing Ã¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸Â
You need to change this settings.when I switch on the video it will be on. when I see in Participate my video will be off why these settings remove this settings as soon as possible I hope you make this update as soon as possible
Best app for video conferencing. It gives many options to the host. But the ZOOM needs to improve the muting process. As the host, I should be able to unmute a particular participant without a message (The host wants to unmute you). Then it will be good. So, please fix that problem in the next update. I am still giving you 5 stars..
Very awesome application
Good to learning
Nice but if we on the video the logo of video in participants list it will be showing video off only for us not everyone pls fix this bug
Perfect
Very good visuals Audio occasionally problematic
Thank you for this platform in the nation and the globe, and. may the Lord measure an abundance of his favor upon it.... in Jesus name....
Video call limit should be for an hour.
I am trying to switch on my camera but in participation list it is showing off . Please help me Thanks you.
Very nice aap.
It is not joining
Not so good needed very much net
Good for kids online classes
Missing the background changing option in mobile version
Generally good. It does drop people's voices every so often.
Great tool
Can't rejoin after get disconnected
This is really a good App to attend online classes and for other purposes...
I give 4 stars because there is no option to remove profile photo. Please add this option as soon as possible. Then I'll give you 5 stars.
This app is good for online class
Great Ã°Å¸â€˜Â app
Nice app very helpfull to this
Nice
Only just started don't no enuf about it yet
Pls give background set option in android
This app is very helpfull if we have a good network connection and internet then for them it is a very nice app but for those who dont have proper internet connection then it is not good bcz it directly lack and shows connecting and error code so I think this app is helpfull for online classes
I like it, it's so good on meeting
Very good app...
I'm impressed
Very nice app Good app
Very good for every day use.
Fantastic app
Its a very good app, but just that it consumes a lot of battery and after the call is finished, if you try to touch or phone, you will burn your hand, mean to say that the phine becomes very hot after the call.
Works great, I used to be able to connect audio through a phone call. That was more convenient for me
Being able to see each other has kept us all close and going during this challenging time.
This also great Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
It good and support app
The zoom app is very nice app but it can cut the call in 45 or anytime otherwise it is very nice app...
Good Ã°Å¸â„¢â€šÃ¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸ÂÃ¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸Â

Perfect app for online meetings and high quality videos and many and many features but only one of the problem is it is consuming more data,so I would prefer this app for online meetings
Good app but when I am going to other app my video has been stopped or strucked =_= so I am rating 4 star ....
Really so helpful, getting to know how to use it is opening a whole new world for me.
I liked this aap it has various option and very helpul for group chat.

Thats good
Nice and uptodate
Very good app
Its an excellent app. It works very well. The only reason i gave it a four star becoz there is no feature to change it to dark mode without changing the whole system's theme. They should add this feature in android too.
Excellent working

It's nice. I mean the features are improving day by day and it's really fun using Zoom
It's very good to use and I really appreciate it but only one thing is there is no virtual background options in phone that's why I gave four stars rating
This is nice app but you should give virtual background permission for all mobilesÃ°Å¸â€œÂ±Ã°Å¸â€œÂ±Ã°Å¸â€œÂ±Ã°Å¸â€œÂ±

If you are a student, don't use this application. It would be a complete timewaste. Another application suggestion for online classes is 'Teachmint'. Try using. Thank me later Ã°Å¸ËœÅ 
Good Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â .
You can attended nettings any meetings this app is very useful to me during this virus you can chat with your friends family this app needs internet
This app is overall good but it has the worst screen on chrome the video is only in white and black but on android and ios devices it runs best
Very good

It works and is good for chatting in groups.
Good Ã¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸Â is very nice to have this app. And meet family and friends.
So nice My only problem is that it's not completely free
Jump of every minute
Only one I've used. Good and steady signal. (No problems so far)

Not bad. Zoom is quite useful app nowadays Good Job Zoom team . Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬
4 and a half
"""Allow participants to only chat with host"" - this option has now gone missing from at least the free membership accounts. I think a lot of school teachers (with kids/students willing to create nuisance in the class) will appreciate the revival of this feature. Beyond that, love the app!"
its really good
Can be a little lagging but it is probably my internet completely free and easy to use
The app is good but plz extend the participants limit. That will be really helpful
This app is good. But, why android 5.1.1 can't use virtual background? I very want it. And, If i zoom i must use a background. Please uptade with android 5.1.1 can use virtual background.
This app is too good
Its so useful
Meetings is very bad
So much problems
Nothing to say.. But I think using system could have been more easy.
I can't sign up. it saying you're not eligible for sign up
It's good but signing problem is most
This is good app It is very useful for students

I am having so much problam in maths class because my sir's video is not zomm in so please solve my problam Thanku
Much satisfactory
We can read i like this app
Fix your clearity issues then i will rate 5 star
Nice app for video conferencing. But the ZOOM needs to improve or update the muting process. As the host I should be able to mute and unmute a participant without them click on the it. It was like that initially but now it has changed. As the host I should be able to unmute a particular participant without a message (The host wants to unmute you). Please that should be fixed but I will still give you 5 stars
This is an excellent app and makes the world smaller. If you look at any of the negative reviews you will normally find that it is their hardware or the quality of their internet connection that is the problem. Despite working with so many different devices and internet providers etc, ZOOM usually works anyway. The controls are pretty intuitive. A great app. Update: Continue to grow their capabilities and is a very valuable connection during the pandemic. Was this review helpful?
It's just unique and very easy to use. It's got a really good quality even with the least updated tools and it takes just a click to get started amongst devices. It equally has nothing much to worry about once the internet supply is considerable. It's the ideal in my opinion. Thanks, David.
Good application for online meetings and classes. This application is specially useful for students and teaching staff and the students who are studying in every field of life. There are more of controls in this application that are very useful features of this application. I personally like it and recommend to others that they can try it for there online meetings. I have a suggestion for this application developers that please increase the free meeting time from forty minutes to one hour.
This is very good app. I can do my online classes in this app. And my father can do his meetings too!! Five stars! But still, i have some of these problems,1) I get out ifthemeeting even I have an excellent network connection. 2) There is a bug that whenever I join a meeting without a link and give the passcode, IT SAYS INCORRECT PASSCODE. So these are the problems Im facing in this app so I hope Zoom.Us will fix it. Thank you....
Wow! As a student, all my friends, family, relatives, far cousins, (almost everyone) can have fun! I truly ADORE this app! Thank you Zoom! Even though most of my friends have the virtual background feature, I don't. I use a Samsung Tablet which is up to date with Zoom updates and device updates. Please let me know when the issue is fixed. From a Zoom user.
Hopefully I'll get more skilled at ZOOM meetings (I've only had 2). The link that was sent to me wasn't sent as a hyperlink so it took me a minute (or 4) to type in the necessary info to join the meeting. Not sure if that's a problem with my email, my service provider, the ZOOM host or just a momentary lapse. Quality of audio and video was exceptional.
Loved this app. It helps to create, schedule, and join meetings. And you have added the virtual backgrounds. Thats great! I would suggest you to add the virtual backgrounds with video backgrounds, video filters and studio effects not only on PC but on android as well. Anyways, I still appreciate your hard work. Well done?Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸ËœÆ’
Sorry i was writting bad review today on this apps due to malfunction on my mic and sound. After further checking i found that the upgrade version will reset your mic and sound setup hence it may not working properly. So, in order to solve the problem, u hv to open your phone setup and check your apps.mgmt to turn on the mic.
Zoom is feature rich, simple to install and use, and has bolstered its security in response to criticism, which is encouraging. ... With 24/7 live support, a clean interface and, most importantly, a smooth conferencing experience, Zoom is a good option for online video conferencing. You can sign up to Zoom here.
This is a great app! Very clever setup and it's completely free! (except the pro version that needs money to be able to change the Personal Meeting ID but it's completely free other than that)It's super easy to use, useful to workers, teachers, students and more! It's super easy again. Keep up the good work!
It's very Convenient, you can communicate with people all around the globe..I'm impressed to be able to congregate with my congregation, on a regular basis; and see their faces. It's Awesome !!!!Thumbs Up!! Super!! Also It's good in keeping up with Family and friends !!Karean
It's the best conference app I have ever used in my life! Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¯Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¯Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¯ I can easily join in meetings and it is very convenient to enter. Also, my son, an Eighth Grade student, he can easily attend online classes with just a tap on this APP! It can suppress unwanted noises when having a meeting with just a tap. I think that this is a great conference app and it is very easy to use and I love this APP!!!Ã°Å¸ËœÂ®Ã°Å¸ËœÂÃ°Å¸ËœÂ®Ã°Å¸ËœÅ Ã°Å¸ËœÅ Ã°Å¸ËœÅ 
This is a very good app with least time taking and net also..... For 5 meetings it that only 500MB.....THAT GREAT I have suggested is app to all my friends and relatives. In this lockdown period I can do my classes and tution properly by sitting at home. This app is really awsome. My tution teacher as well as my class teacher also use this app. But I have only one request if you can please extend the time of the zoom meeting which is 40mins. If you do it for 1 hour, we all will be very happy.
For all the critisism it receives, Zoom still is the best video calling platform especially for those who want the plateform simple and easy to use. The vanilla UI design accompanied with seamless connectivity even in low bandwidth, Zoom indeed is a rare finding (read blessing) in this pandemic season. Shout out to the Zoom team, for they made sure that the world stays connected even in these difficult times :)
Edit 11/26/20: it is 1000% better. I have no problems of any sort. I'm now a happy camper. Recent update no bueno. Sound is all chopped up. I can barely hear others and they hear me. It's like a cell phone with a bad reception. I've been using this since March. There has been no problems until now. Please correct soon. I need for my meetings
Best app for conducting online classes with good voice and video quality also the security system is great which allows to have a great environment. The recording feature is the great, helps in revision of lectures. The features like white board, annotations, screen sharing, audio sharing, images and etc. makes it different from others. According to my personal view it's great enough and also the best, free app. this app. helped India and other countries all over the world in pandemic situation
My experience was excellent. This zoom was done and is done 3 days a week now with my mental health therepist. If i didnt have her on zoom in my situation where im at mentally with where i live. I would be in a mental breakdown. This covid i cant go see her in person and this is the closest to seeing her i have. Im trapped in a place i pay rent for and its mind twisting people around me. Thank you zoom. Surely my life saver. How many others deal with mental abuse? This is our escape and closest
I like this app a lot, though am a student,i can listen carefully, everything works fine and the best thing I like is the raise hand option so we don't we don't have to chat a million times. Anyways, I gave this app a five star as It is perfect, thanks to the person who made this app.
Very nice app.. I am a 9 years old girl. Everyday I do my online classes in this app there is no problem in this app.. I like this app very much but one thing is wrong that sometimes there is report problem but it can't stop me to give this app 5 stars and I am giving this app 5 stars for the wonderful classes.. And one thing guys I want to tell that this is my mother's mobile phone Ã°Å¸Â¤Â­Ã°Å¸Â¤Â­Ã¢ËœÂºÃ¯Â¸Â
This app is a wonderful app. It's updating very good. In the new feature we can make a channel and chat with friends. This app can be used without signing in also. In a very simple method. It is safe app for meetings. This app has screen sharing option which can show our presentation to people.
I appreciate this app very much. As a Jehovah's Witness, we use it daily for our ministry and twice a week for our congregation meetings. It has been a wonderful tool and even life saving, as we continue to Worship God. It has allowed us to associate and up build one another during these critical times.
Great app for online work meeting and discussion. Add new features like show screen to all the joiners not only host. Add HD option for those who have wifi you can enable it and can show you work more sharper and contased. Add new UI this is now boring UI add a new UI. Add private muting of participants so they can not disturb you while meeting. Add a new call talk feature in it. Add new app logo you know this is now getting boring. But thanks for rest things in this app. Your faithfully user
This is a very good meeting app, defintely recommended, the best thing is that you can actually add contacts and chat. The only thing is that the meeting stops automatically after 40 mins and i have to start it again so we can continue with the meeting. Can you please remove this feature, althugh its a very good app.
I had a very difficult time the first time I tried to use it even with the technicians help. They were able to finally resolve the glitches. I since then have used it for 3 additional meetings and no more issues with it!! Luv it & recommend it for medical meetings with one on one with your Doctor!!
It's a good app but not stable in audio caling . Also I can't record all details shown in display like a screen recorder app. It just records audio. You know I want to share the recorded file to other students who didn't join the meeting. It's very kind of you to help me solve this problem.
I really like using this app, for school, and for chatting. It lets me talk with people with barely any delay. It is easy to use, don't listen to people about their internet being perfect and not being able to do anything, because it was the other side with bad internet.
I like quality and easy way I can get on and use the app . Be with my friends and family this way. We have been using this app for religious meeting with very few problems. Very clear and easy to get on to the meeting.. Thanks for this app. We have also used this app for reunions of friends I have not seen or spoken to in 20 yrs or more. Great times was had all. Thanks agains.
This app is very helpful and useful to the students and officers for online learning and for meeting. Due to covid 19 students cannot go to school so this app is very useful and it is easy to use also. Download this app it will help you a lot. I am using this app since 6 months and I don't have any complain and problem with this app. You can also use for taking with many friends in the world. The creator of this app is very creative. I salute his thoughts and it's the best app for students ever
Amazing app! It helps me during quaritine to talk to my friends and have class at home! I recommend this app! It has lots of space for a lot of people! I don't know it only have a 3.6 star rating! Its a very good app and I would recommend it more than any meeting app!
It is amazing it always brings the best quality sound and picture. I should say that I haven't seen any other meeting app that is having the features like zoom, it is the best meeting app I have ever used. It seems that all the world is collected in this app this is much better than I was expecting I would like to say that you should install this app if you are finding an app for meeting..
Very informative since my eating habit explain why my blood sugars have been going the wrong way, my portions are too much, my selection of food items are wrong. In general I need to change 100% of what and when and how I eat. It will be a challenge for this 73 yr old man.
I really love this app I am able to join in on the spiritual feeding and encouragement when it is available for me. I even get to spend time with my brothers and sisters daily even though the pandemic is going on we all can stay in touch. I highly appreciate this app.
This makes our work more easier and makes the world more smaller. We are more comfortable with it and we doesn't get tired Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¦ if we compare with our earlier conversation in Cafe or classes in school makes us very exhausted Ã°Å¸ËœÂ´. If we have connectivity problem than it's not zoom's problem I am happy Ã°Å¸ËœÅ  with it you must try it for a once Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€°Ã°Å¸ËœÅ 
Best app for meetings and school classes.....the only problem i am facing is that zoom needs sign in each time i open...this problem is only with me as i asked my friends about this problem....but overall this app is a very perfect and suitable for your device... if you need a perfect app for your buisness or other meetings ..then you are on the right path...all you have to do is just click th INSTALL button above....
Great app works awesome on my new phone, on m yold phone that had had for 2 years it sucked! It made the phone super hot, kicked me off at least 10 times in a 2 hour meeting and wouldn't let me back in and at 100% it always killed my battery. Now I have absolutely no problems with it...Ã°Å¸â€™Â¯
This app has kept me sane during 2020. First, as a teacher, I was able to stay working and my students learning. I am in a personal private group now in the fall, and the leader puts us in breakout rooms for short discussions. That feature is genius!
It is the BEST app but ......... while I record the online meeting why the video is only recorded not audio .....it says sry we can't record the audio of a video cause the recording app has not allowed the permission.....chill I try to record from my mobile phone as a participant...... but the audio is not recorded so plz allow the permission that audio would be also recorded and it would be easy for we student. I beg the developer of this app to allow the permission that we can do screen record
It is an excellent app in lockdown to study in home Ã°Å¸ÂÂ¡ and by it I cam join classes immediately and there are many features in it which make me comfortable with this application and the main thing is that there I never saw bugs ,. Or glitches in this application and it is also good for those people who don't have good smartphones as it can run in those smartphones and you can freely allow this application to access your location ,. Contacts,storage too.and this app is excellent Ã°Å¸ËœÆ’Ã°Å¸ËœÆ’
Excellent Online Meeting application with a variety of options. Breakout rooms, cohost are excellent tools for conducting multiple meetings concurrently. Latest updates allow cohosts to move between rooms freely. Screen sharing with system audio & video is perfect. Even remote control of shared screen is working perfect. Live streaming option for Facebook, YouTube and custom streaming is of excellent quality. Cloud recording and its management is very good.
This is a very nice app. It's updates are fantastic. But the problem is we can't keep filters and backgrounds in Android. I tried do it from website of zoom.us and when I host the meeting from there it does not open. Please make an update for Android vertual backgrounds!
Has Been an absolute life saver!...Yes there has been alot of growth in the apps updates, but all of them have (Up to this point) been right on target to improve the App. Thanks so much for doing a great job! :-) Keep up the Great work :-)
Great, I love this update I love that now it shows the logo of the person in the chatbox, it's very nice for me because I do online classes. Oh and when something's don't show, it's YOUR network problem. But still DANG! it's been giving a lot of problems
It's very good, I go to lots of meetings for lots of different things, I love it and I have recommended it to 7 people now they told their friends and family so it's good to keep in touch with people all over the world especially during the pandemic a total lifesaver in lots of ways! Thanks
Really good easy to connect with people at long distance amazing clarity more than 200-300 people at a time. Really appreciate for coming up with such app which really reduces the distance b/w people of different countries and brings them close.
My whole collage uses ZOOM and also collect fee for taking our online class ther collect fee from us but they dont pay anything for the zoom since zoom is acting as a barries between students and teachers but teacher are making huge profits sitting in home so I advice zoom to bring out premium service with resonlabe rate and I want zoom to collect fee from teachers,Ã°Å¸ËœÂÃ°Å¸ËœÂÃ°Å¸ËœÂ
It's a great app and I've definitely seen the improvements on features over the past few months. It's been an asset in communicating with people especially during lockdown. It's straight forward to use.
Best application for any kinds of personal or business meeting. And provides better sound quality.and also most useful for online classes.... We use it for online class and we are very satisfied with this application.
Before this update the app is not so good but after the update the app is working fantastic and zoom developer has added Virtual background which is my favourite option in zoom but before it was available in pc only but it is also available in android and the issue which I've mentioned before about video is not working that is also solved. Thank you zoom good customer response keep it up
But have a problem in entering the meeting when the host is sharing the screen. Please add a ringer when someone enters waiting room. So that host can let them enter in the meeting. And let everyone know about the update if any. And plz xtend the meeting limit for more than 40 minutes
The app was quite helpful in lockdown. It is really easy to use but since the last update the audio is totally messed up. The voice keeps cracking and you cannot listen anything. Please fix this issue.
This aap is amazing!! I use this app for my online classes..but it takes time to prepare meeting. It is not that much quick. You feel angry when you are already late for meeting. This has happened to me many times. But it is my mistakeÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€¦..
I'm a 58 yo piano teacher and went virtual with zoom in March... it's worked great, the sounds come through fine if we wear headphones and the wifis are stable... and it enabled me to keep working thru this crazy time. Thanks zoom!
Everything is top class,i loved the app but from some days if the host turn on the camera im not able to see the full screen only the mid part is seen and im not even able to see full screen in landscape view. Exept this problem for me everything is fine and its easy and im enjoying online classes so i request you to clear this problem
Like just about all the other churches in the world, the church I serve moved to this app for weekly services and classes during the pandemic. It's easy to use, versatile, and it simply works.
Everything works well, except the virtual background on android. I'm using Redmi Note 8 and the option for virtual background is not there, which means I cannot activate it. I don't know if it's my phone who doesn't support the feature, but if it's a bug please fix this. Thank you
Teacher training and development of the most of the most of the most of the best way to get the best way to get the best way of life, and a few days, 5LYD the same. The first to hear that you are not the intended recipient, you will need the latest. The first to know if there was no longer wish you all. I 2nd yobs I am looking forward to hearing best way to
I love zoom it helps me communicate with a lot of friends, but I would've loved if we can send videos when we make a chat with a friend or if we can name them as we want or if we can put a profile picture for a channel but in general this app is amazing which is why I gave it 5 stars Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â
I have used Zoom for my Virtual Personal Training sessions for several months now. The quality and connection are always great. I haven't had to cancel a session ever.
I really like alot because it's amazing items of meetings, It's the best app ever, the only thing that I thought should be improved is that the eccho is too high when two mic are on if possible let the engineer work towards it,
Excellent app for private and large group use. It helps me to stay in contact with friends and family, makes a great difference to life throughout 2020 and beyond of course. Keep up the good work, Ã°Å¸â€â€ Ã°Å¸â€â€ Ã°Å¸â€â€ Ã°Å¸â€â€ Ã°Å¸â€â€ 
Excellent app. I started using the free app for several months, but as I came to use it quite extensively (as meeting host), I purchased a license. They provide excellent support. Highly recommended.
This app is amazing! It has truly changed my life and helped me keep my business going during Covid-19. Thank you Zoom for keeping the small business world up and running during our time of uncertainty!
I love this app so much but some updates should be there If my net is low the screen should not be small because I am a student if it happens we cannot see the screen I am disappointed another one is that when we send message there should be a option like delete from everyone because when I was using my laptop it hangs and then by mistake it write something in the bar and goes to mam and that time I got punishment by mam plz add features in next update plz do this update and fix other bugs too.
Great app.... Helped me to join classes ... But, if our birth year is 2002 or up we can't sign in My birth year is above 2002 .so if I try to sign in, it shows age is not appropriate So I signed in with 2000 as my birth year Which was my only way to sign in.... So please fix that .....except that zoom is the best!
It is not bad video clarity is very good more than 35 members can join video call and it is useful for online class And then one query is their In the zoom app if i go out from zoom app the video was turned off that one is mistake there please find out this and correct that one this is user queries ok.
This is the best thing to happen to us, especially in the lockdown. I've had many virtual birthday Ã°Å¸Å½â€š parties with my family. It's such a comfort to be part of a funeral and other ceremony, remotely and be identified by everyone as opposed to being lost in a huge crowd of physical presence. The cost of arranging these events are also minimised to prevent wastage.
I have run my business through ZOOM for 3 years now and wow!!!! It always shows up for me and pulls through. Without the steadiness, reliability and ease of use of ZOOM my business would not be where it is.
The best meeting app ever it's voice doesn't break or echo and that's the best part of it we are able to do screen sharing to show some important work and complete it in home in this pandemic. It helped in my studies very much. Thank you Zoom
ZOOM is a very helpful tool to stay apart during these times without losing connection. If anything, I advise attempts should be made to try and make it more user-friendly.
If u are facing problems in the app ....u can clear all ur background running apps and the switch off ur mobile ...after a second just switch it on then u can free flowingly work with zoom no network errors may occur ....this process must be repeated at the time of logging in every time ....this may help u
Really like Zoom meeting, has what it take for confidencial meeting, lock meeting, spotlight a person. But would really like to see if you can do a split screen, so that when doing an interview it doesn't keep changing screen.
Very useful app specially in this pandemic time as all the meetings and classes are online so this is a great app to use now. Sometimes it have some connection issues but everyone know that nothing is perfect and we can't totally belief on network strengths. Anyways your app is great. Loved it
I enjoy being able to connect with people via Zoom when I can't be with them in person. The service typically runs very smoothly - assuming my internet connection stays strong.
(5 stars) cause before you join you can edit and close off things which you don't want and also you can hear the speaking of others to in the video and please make a update of where you can still have a video chat togther when your internet is off or is fixing and it's a great app thank you! for making this and I wish the update can be a lot quicker.
Excellent app we used during covid sessions. Very easy to use for the less technical participants. The app works well in slow connections and we are able to hold meetings effectively during lockdown.
This is really nice app.and l am really impressed.I used this app for my school classes. When I used first time this app my Video and sound are not working properly but it is working properly . I am very grateful to you .
This app is a very good app to use especially when you are on your cell phone I have an upgrading k51metro Android and it works just perfect if your phone is not upgraded it's really not going to work that's the only bad little thing I have to say about Zoom so if you have a Android and it's not upgraded you might want to upgrade it because you're going to have problems with it
As the months have gone by our association has gotten better at using Zoom. Everything seems to be working like a fine tuned watch. Thank You all for making keeping in touch with family, friends, and our organizations painless and trouble free. Most importantly without cost to the general public. Thank You very much to all of you behind the seans at ZOOM. Ã¢Å“Å’Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â
I appreciate the privilege of seeing, my audience faces thank you so much for the experience. I still feel the same about zoom today. every thing is still the same. Great!
It is a very good app..It is easy to use....the only problem is that for chat box...try to make a tab on the screen for chat box instead of going somewhere else...
It's excellent. Best video call,messaging, phone call and much more. This application is nessacery for me because, I use the application for online classes. Download this application now,rate it 5 stars.
My Jehovah's Witness congregation uses Zoom all the time for our meetings since we still don't want any any to spread covid-19. All kinds of extras. Easy to use. We regularly have 160+ people in the meeting and never have any trouble.
"Best but if it would be offline app then it would be great..just add this update which will be offline then your rating will be 5..and some people are there that write rating that ""voice is not coming "" they don't even turn on call over internet Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€š..Zoom just focus on your app not these bad reviews"
Excellent ! Zoom meetings are often More versatile than 'real' face to face meetings. Can participate from anywhere, anytime. Great for saving our planet, with Transport Carbon Footprint of Zero Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š Welcome to 21st century future.
It is very important, good, convenient and helpful it is the best online teaching app compared to other apps I rate zoom 5 stars because of the best online teaching class in the world I wish for more updates that will make zoom the best in the whole world
Camera stopped working properly after latest update as at 4th October 2020. Please fix this. Edited: Thanks zoom for fixing this issue in the update. 15th December 2020.
I love zoom. I like it even better on my PC. I still can't get virtual backgrounds to work on my chromebook or Android phone and I read in a technical magazine that you guys updated the android zoom and chromebook zoom app to utilize the virtual backgrounds setting.
Zoom is the best social connection there is considering our time of seperation. It's truely a blessing to have this app and to know that there's no limitation to any culture to connect with. Thank you zoom for being so created.
The most important thing, that I discovered about the zoom app, you can put a picture in the background of the zoom meeting ; That's is so wonderful Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ¾
Being a teacher I am using different platforms for different webinars and study sessions but I simply feel more comfortable, informed and vigilante about students activities and equally comfortable while applying different styles of teaching.
Using it for one-to-one meetings, small seminars and talks to large groups. Works well for all. Wish the Android version had all the features of PC and Apple versions, but still a great app.
This is a good app. But we can find the good qualities by sign in only. Some bad reviews are caused by Internet problems. Really it is best and good online meeting app. I feel good quality of ZOOM by attending online class
I have used Zoom numerous times. Especially now that we're in the midst of a pandemic. I love Zoom and have only had good experiences with it. It's easy to use and I recommend it to everyone!
This app is great and all but I agree Some improvements must be done like When you need to go to another app during zoom, your video gets turned off automatically and when you need to go to participant or to the chat section it gets turned off So pls improve this If not for this problem this app would have been perfect So pls improve it and ROCK ONÃ°Å¸ËœÆ’Ã°Å¸ËœÆ’Ã°Å¸ËœÆ’Ã°Å¸ËœÆ’Ã°Å¸ËœÆ’Ã°Å¸ËœÆ’
The zoom cloud meetings are new innovation and make physical traveling unnecessary. Global interaction is now possible with minimum costs and risky traveling dangers are averted with minimum time wastage. Thanks to the originators and organizers for this wonderful feat.
Works flawlessly from my phone , I use a USB-c to hdmi to connect to a TV if I have multiple people on the call with me. So far has made all of my work calls seamless.
Very great app it's really helping people in this pandemic to conduct classes and job meetings easily and without any app purchases or problems it's a really really great app I love it!Ã¢ÂÂ¤ Must dowload with it you can join as much us people you want and conduct with your friends and family memebers from far far places and country Ã¢ÂÂ£Ã¯Â¸Â
Satisfied,it has resolved all the issue - Shows the connected time. - automatically connects audio - enable/disable sound - video problem when we go to other apps is also resolved Etc.
Awesome app,download it!and use it for good use,like talk with your friends by making your own zoom to chat with your friends! And do online classes!
As long as I using this, it's work pretty well and almost no big deal happened, but one thing that I have no idea why it's makes my phone overheated even just a quarter hour of usage.
I don't know why but I lost sound during meeting. At the beginning I would hear. Then some munites later no more sound. While the meeting is ongoing. Me I can't hear them anymore
I appreciate of zoom. Because, It is one and only app which provides good quality of video and It is a good source to take a meeting. I am so happy from this app.
It's so much better video quality than facebook messenger. We find it about five times the quality than any other video chat. It's not just business it's great for family.
This is fantastic! I can easily and, without a load of difficult passwords etc, join my workout group. I like having the option to myself not be on video.
I have been invited to 3 zoom meetings and once I understood that I had to turn on the video, audio and clicked to join. The program is amazing.
I'm giving this app five star because this appnow contains the original sound option .... Before this option I couldn't hear my teachers voice clearly .... Now it doesn't contain any beep or any cut when my teacher speaks it is just completely an amazing upgrade by zoom just fantastic and love it ....Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬
This a nice app i use this for meetings and my son use for classes but the reason i gave 3 star is when my sons online exam was going on google forms my son copy link and paste it in google it start and zoom automatically closes his teacher shout at him why you got out of class
It was a nice... I can see my beloved friends because of ZOOM app i can finaly m3e5 my friends, classmates, teachers, and my loveing grandma and grapa.. I just wanna say THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE ZOOM APP I CAN FINALY MEET MAY BELOVED ONES AND FOR THE BASHERS THERE IM JUST 11 YEARS OLD SO PLEASE GIVE ME SOME RESPECT THATS ALL.. AGAIN THANK YOU ZOOM
With This new update of zoom version, i have not satisfied, because in zoom version 5, which was a rare version but this versions are not there spotlight video, i request the developers to have spotlight video, please.
A lifesaver during this pandemic! Able to connect with friends and family all over the world! Wish I was able to see more squares on my tablet at one time like my husband can on his iPad. Hopefully they update that soon!
Zoom is so helpful app for attending meetings of school or office like this so many meetings we can attend but one thing I cant understand that I am facing a problem with the zoom after downloading zoom after 1 month it's a trouble to my daughter of zoom please can any body help me I mean Please solve my problem
Love it. Such a clear video and voice which is imperative for school. Every now and again you have a glitch but always get any problems taking care of
I think it's the best audio/video program on the market. The only thing I don't like is the increase in security that's become necessary with additional passwords etc.but I get it..
I read to a lady in Long term care over zoom each week. We share Bible verses and songs and prayers. It means so much to her to have the faith connection that she misses in these covid times. Thank you zoom for making our weekly visits possible.
It is a great app. but, please add a feature to record the zoom meeting so it is easy for visually impaired. thank you.
I have had good clarity with voice and video using Zoom. I love the control features as well as the participant features that are available on the Zoom platform.
Great app for connecting to Zoom meetings. If you have Wi-Fi or high-speed data it does a much better job than other videoconferencing services.
This is a really good app...you can also share screen on zoom video calling and annotate the screen also.....you can even voice call and send messages in any device.......you can even record the meeting....I love this aap
Best app ever. The meetings work very well, chatting also works but joining zoom meeting on phone also means the phone call. This is very smart calling app.Ã°Å¸ËœËœÃ°Å¸ËœËœÃ°Å¸Â¥Â°Ã°Å¸Â¥Â°
This app is mostly helpful for lecture. But this are a most problem to connectivity issues and network problem at my handset pliz all android phone are connectivity issues solutions in this app.. thnak you.Ã¢ÂÂ£Ã¯Â¸Â
Thank you for finally fixing the bug. When i updated my phone to android 10 (miui12) my audio was not heard by any other person even after unmute . Also my phone's microphone was fine i have tested it.
It's very good to the people especially to mee and I'm very happy to say that now a days we r studing in zoom means it's very great we thought that we don't have any way to study so, we got this app tqq to the people who did this app I'm very very thanking u people...thanka a lot...
Zoom is the most efficient way to visualize with love ones and your church or organizations for those of us that are just normal people who miss our love ones and friends during this pandemic.
this is a bloody app i haven't like but i like it. It has so many bugs. The fool people are using this app and got mad. Some ghost also appear in meeting but no body notice them. Kindly don't allow the girls to come in the meeting with makeup some children get scared with them. This app is inpirational to those who have some issue in their brain. Iam telling some name please report them,ayan moiz and huzaifa they are using this app for studies and this app is just for fun and nothing kindly.)
Has improved so much with security, I am amazed! Changed my review, it has been amazing how much it's improving with every update
This app is amazing we have add our class, meeting, we have to add username and password and your photo can also come you can enjoy there many skin tones i love it i have add my friends and do funny momentsÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€š me host and i just put everyone mute and chat disabled and they raise and i donot make them unmute like my some teachers. LolÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€šÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€¦Ã°Å¸ËœÂ
As one of Jehovah's Witnesses it is a great way to see everyone both near and far. We get the opportunity to talk with one another and spend time with one another during this pandemic when e are unable to meet face to face. We really appreciate having Zoom.
It's good it deserves 5 stars but where is the virtual background If I search it it is saying to go to more and click virtual background but l didn't have that In more one more thing when my video is on in participants it is showing my video is off any solution in android mobile how do I get virtual background please say anyone Ã°Å¸ËœÂµÃ°Å¸ËœÂµÃ°Å¸ËœÂµÃ°Å¸ËœÂµÃ°Å¸ËœÂ¡Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¡
After updating it the 5.2.0 version was not opening.I could not identify the problem. I tried for more than ten times but there was the same problem. It was not opening.
Zoom is the best for online classes. And it is awesome because it doesn't kick me out of the meeting or turns up the volume on it's own it has good video quality.
I have the zoom app downloaded on my Android phone. All good. I also have a tablet connected with the same phone # as my cell phone. I like to download the zoom app on my tablet, but to no avail. I have many apps, that is the same on both phone and tablet. Why can't I download the zoom app on my tablet?
Fun to use. Just wish I could see everyone on one page and also use zoom backgrounds but they don't seem to be available for tablets, o ly pcs.
This app is nice even all things are very nice but I want to sahi ne but there is nothingI was a very angry for this app please resolve this problem and the big problem is that the mic is not a unable to speak when host also UN mute me but I can't UN mute myself please solve this problem
Multiplatform, ui intuitive & feature rich, incredibly stable & high performance even on small (high performance) LG G7, including multisession conference, excellent audio & video quality, remote device sharing is amazing, devs keep improving & supporting app. Very nice that free session times extended during covid, much appreciated.
Zoom is a daily lifeline for me. That they keep working on it to make it more secure and use their friendly is invaluable. I am so grateful for this app. Thank you
This app is very nice to attend meetings...Ã°Å¸ËœËœvery nice for students, teacher, business partners, business man..... etc it is the best app for attending meetings or making meetings for android, iphone, tablets and laptops..... etc. It is free for attending meetings...Ã°Å¸ËœËœÃ°Å¸ËœËœÃ°Å¸ËœÂÃ°Å¸ËœÂÃ°Å¸ËœÅ Ã°Å¸ËœÅ 
It's really smooth for use since I use it for my class 3 online classes, I love the new update bro. BTW, in the next update you could make it so that we can see the messages someone sent to someone who we are chatting with too *not much of a good idea is it*
I really enjoy zoom, its a wonderful way to get in touch, & as our places of worship are closed down for now, we are able to meet for spiritual food, & upbuilding association. Julia
My Dr.&friend asked me to zoom him.This app was a quick download in play store or zoom itself!Great concept for telehealth..So try it. My kids always video me now I can expand this to professionals in my daily life..
20 years of conferencing and no platform has felt as intuitive, been as powerful, and provided so much raw capabilities as Zoom. The future is very bright!
This is very Good App. It take low data and video quality was high. And this app is useful in online classes. And its make meeting safe. It say give password.
Awesome but it have limited meeting time and this app hasn't a subscription only limited free time for meeting it should be corrected to until the host has not ended the meeting.
I don't know how much it cost for someone to create their own personal Zoom meeting or how much a company/business pays for a dedicated # to have regular Zoom meetings. I've found that yes I need to go sit w/some free Wi-Fi somewhere so I don't waste data. Good if people would learn how to click on their mic & their pic. Nice invention. Good for the pandemic. But I've gotten tired of everyone saying Zoom's as good as in person. ALIVE PHONE CALLS are best.
So far my personal experience has been top notch, image quality of the video chat is good and the audio is as fast as a voice call
This app has been great as it has enabled us as a group to carry on taekwondo training through lockdown as a group and a way of seeing people that we haven't seen for a whileÃ°Å¸â€˜Â
A very good app but why not store the chat history for the whole session? When I'm out then in, everything in the chat disappears even if I wasn't not the host and the session was continuous.
Super app but signing in alone is so difficult but super.google meet is not nice zoom is super pls download zoom. and zoom is so secure and we left the meeting it will be show in zoom but in google meet not this like super zoom thumbs up
Very useful app. Very excellent tool of communication.very important tool to connect people all over the world. Thank you so much.
It is nice app for studies during corona virus my online class organised I am student of class 6 and I have given five starts as it deserves 5 star..........Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â it actually have no problem but it has some bugs so improove it and it is awesome
It is a good app but we also have some problems in it like our video is turned off when we are in participants or not at the gallery view or safe driving mode it is very bad app with this problem also it has many connectivity issues. Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸â€˜Å½Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ Ã°Å¸ËœÂ  do something for this problem fast I will uninstall this app in a few days.
That's amazing! Can't you provide time indicating option on the main window, on the call, just a suggestion.
Simply awesome. Zoom is a life saver, time saver. It takes away the stress of going from place to place for various meetings.
This has been a fabulous app during this time. I have been able to stay in touch with my grandchildren on the other side of the country. With screen share they can read to me. Very user friendly.
It's just great to do stuff and interact with people while you have to quarantine. Thankful for this app. Haven't had problems yet. I hope I didn't jinx it now.Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€°
It's very good after adding virtual background on android. I like this feature very much. That's why zoom deservs five star.
The sound on the app needs to be improved because there's been constant issues with it. I still give you a 5 star rating for now.
This version is not better than previous version.previous version of this app is better.my internet coonection is ok but other's voice is not clear.do not download this app and do not waste your internet.
Love this app. I only have experience with Zoom and Google Meet. Really like this better, easier to use for me.
This app is good but it has a major problem in that when I write correct password to enter meeting it shows incorrect password even I write correct password please solve this problem very soon
The Zoom helps me very much. To my online class is also going very well. This app is way usefull . Everything is good in this app.
It is an amazing platform where we are connected to our teachers daily and it this situation due to zoom we are able to take our classes easily . I would like to thank you for making our pandemic easy and joyful with studying and connecting to our friends online ... Thank you so much
It is the easiest easiest way to join the meeting I have fun to join it so whenever I have a chance to join a meeting I will just use zoom cloud meeting and the emoji over there can tell our expression and chat is number one
It is the only human contact I have. I use zoom almost everyday. Easy accessible, video and voice are available and clear.
Zoom is a well meeting app and has impressed me a lot ! And,its interface is easy and interactive and gives best meeting procedures .So, I shall give the most ratings regarding above Thanks .Ã°Å¸Å’Â¹Ã°Å¸Å’Â¹Ã°Å¸Å’Â¹
Zoom is amazing and brilliant. But the problem is sometime class is not clear and it has blur. Sometimes I can not other people in zoom metting. Ok
Its a very good app for meeting.. The audio and the video quality is also very good..its perfect for online class and meeting..
very good app. my son online classes will done by this app only . it very helps us but pls cure the problem that if we are not able to connect or some connecting problem from that in the participants our name is present in two times
This app is very good for online classes. It has very good sound and video quality, and renaming option. After updating it works very well.
Wonderful app.. It's BOON during Pandemic.. Couldn't have survived without meeting our people without meeting them on ZOOM.. thank you zoom.. May you zoom many times more such helpful apps..
I'm joining N.A & A.A meetings. No delay, can fear what's being said. I can travel the world and see for my self doesn't matter where I'm at the message is the same, the suggestions are also the same. I'm grateful this was set up to easily get into a meeting. ThanknYou for always being there for me friends. 24hts for me and I wish you another 24 aswell Heather Vancouver, Canada
It is amazing many programs for children and teenagers are able to reach out tutor and encourage young children to do good.
Zoom cloud meetings is a great app that connects people in a way that feels real. Like yo there talking to them face to face. Great App. You should download it ASAP. Ã¢Å“Å’Ã¯Â¸ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€™Æ’
Thank you for released this application. Which is such as a great app for online class and etc. I love it. Always and every day I'm using this application. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much.
It is very easy to use, i love this app zoom app. I can do my class, I can understand all what our teacher says

I love zoom. Thanks for the ability on a android device to have a virtual background. Can you please create the ability to have gallery view on an android device?
I like zoom so much it help us to connect with our colligues and with our family and friends it has countinued our life in lock down and it has also continued the study of childs and office work.i like zoom so much!Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’
It's is good app but on problem in this aap if any student come in the class and abuse any person this is the bad conditions. I want to catch the person but not function in zoom meeting aap plz Ã°Å¸â„¢Â update the zoom.
WONDERFUL APPLICATION, I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS SINCE THE QUARANTINE STARTED IN MARCH 2020 AND I HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUE WITH IT. I JUST WANTED TO MENTION ABOUT THE PRICES YOU MANAGE... I HOPE YOU COULD LOWER THE PRICE. THANKS Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¯Â¸Â
Excellent technology in modern communication system; especially to connect 100 participants at a time.Being a teacher,I fully utilize the apps to take my live classes with my students.
It's a great app but chat should have more functionality like adding GIFs from the stock keyboard instead of those which zoom includes And a new icon would be great with rounded and more responsive UI
Best thing out there for kids' classrooms, getting to the rooms, or catching up with the whole family. Sorry Google and Microsoft.... They gotcha!
I love this app. But there is a thing I don't like about this because you cannot add the people in the group that are not your zoom buddies. Please fix this problem
Zoom is really awesome. I have one doubt. Suppose if in a meeting if the host makes 2 co- hosts and if 1 co- host records the meeting in his/her device will that be recorded and saved in the device of the host and the other co - host ?
I am sure by giving a 5 star rating the team of ZOOM would definitely improve to a better standard. So is my appreciation in advance to the whole team for the solution they have provided.
Great app help me with my at home jobs especially since I'm expecting and this coronavirus is going around so to all you at home mom looking for work this app is a great way to do your virtue jobs are interviews as well as allow your kids to do virtual school from home
It's very useful for learning and teaching too... Thank you very much zoom....in this time I learn so many things from your support...
It was very good. In most of the apps the voice breaks but not in zoom. Is is much better.
I love zoom. It means I can see my grand-niece and my family. It means I can helps others or participate in classes. THANK YOU for a good product.
I love it! It helps me to attend my online classes,itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to use,but if you guys give an update,like more time limit,50 minutes or 1hour...that would be better,pls give an update, i'm giving you guys 5 stars for your great work,love you guys and your appÃ°Å¸ËœËœ

Only one problem. When I am opening the the PARTICIPANTS list, it is showing my video is off, though I have switched on my video after updating. Please look into this!!!!!!!..
Super video quality .. it is good for my online class .. their contacts numbers should be visible .. or else it is like a big problem

It's very much helpful during the corona. Thank you so much zoom for doing unlimited time. Without any obstacles I can enjoy may class. Ã°Å¸ËœÅ Ã°Å¸ËœÅ 
Excellent way of interacting with a wide audience. I haven't experienced any interruptions. Would definitely recommend
The best app I've used when it comes to meetings has the necessary tools to facilitate our school quarantine program and is lovely in math classes and others White board is lovely
Great app for us all students .its very helpful in lockdown to study at home .Our teachers can also easily teach us.......Ã¢ËœÂº

Excellent connectivity and fantastic experience using Zoom. We can get in touch with our family and friends during this time of the year. Thank you entire team of Zoom.

Zoom is amazing! It gives you the chance to meet your family members together at the same time from different location! Audio is also excellent!
If it is possible than please make zoom offline.Otherwise all things are excellent,this is a good app for taking classes and attending meeting in the time of any pandemic
A very good app to use and there is no problem find.
It is very helpful app. You can talk with anyone anywhere. This app helps me to attend my class very easily.
Ã°Å¸ÂÆ’Ã°Å¸Å’ÂºAwesome!!! Sound clear, view crisp easy accessibility thank you. Globally around the world millions of Jehovah's Witnesses appreciate this app we hold funerals upwards of 700 hundred or more can attend joining our spiritual family together. Large Bible Studies thousands attend . So thank for your due diligence keeping us safe. Mr Zoom And companyÃ°Å¸Å’ÂºÃ°Å¸ÂÆ’Ã°Å¸ËœÂ·Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€žÃ°Å¸Â¤â€”Ã°Å¸Â¤â€”Ã°Å¸Â¤â€”Ã°Å¸Â¤â€”Ã°Å¸Â¤â€”Ã°Å¸Â¤â€”Ã°Å¸Â¤â€”
Wow wow wow wow Best Quality And Video. But The Profile Picture Will Not Change Without Logining. But I am Still giving It 5 Stars Ã°Å¸Å’Å¸.
Not good app, I have 1 problem, that is when I give auto connect to audio it is not connecting to audio automatically when I join a meeting
With current situations worldwide, a very good way to stay in touch with more members of family and friends. Most time clear n no interference.
I like Zoom however, is there a way to put the chat and raise your hand button on a cell phone on the screen instead of looking for it as a drop down. Thank you
Church meetings, organization meetings, etc. Has been a great and safe way to communicate during this Covid crises we are experiencing.
I use this app for game nights with friends, chairing community meetings, virtual coffee dates, and visiting with family I can't see because of the pandemic. It's easy, intuitive (my parents are in their seventies, and figured it out in no time), and reliable. I'm a big fan.
Fantastic app. No complications. I like this app. After update this became more easy to use this app. This is a nice app
Team zoom well done for providing such an excellent application for communicat your clients and sharing their experiences or data with their friends family or client with many different options
This application can help me conduct a meeting. Good with friends, teachers, parents, and others. Thank you zoom application ...
Bad features so many times there is audio problem and disconnecting prob . Not good very worst wasting my valuable time connect disconnect again and again
I hv strong internet connection n a corporate account. I am not facing any of the issues in all reviews. Zoom is providing services at discretion depending on the subscription. One thing each one of us shud understand that anything COMES FREE - ONLY WITH COMPROMISE
"TIP OF THE DAY! get the profile picture of the person hosting the meeting, and change your screen name to theirs (and be sure to add "" (Host)"") + your profile pic to theirs in the settings for extra fun!"
It is the excellent app for online classes because it has many feattes than any other apps I love it so much but only one problem it will show my video is off when we go to participants wish it could on when we go to participants also
A very good application, make it easier for us to communicate virtually during the COVID 19 pandemic. Everything went smoothly without significant obstacles
Once that I understood how to use Zoom, it has become easier for me to participate. I now enjoy the Zoom effect. Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€°
Hey! Can you please add an option of removing profile photo? I don't know whether such option is there or not. Even if it is there please keep it at the front of settings and not deep in the settings.
Zoom should alert that the meeting is being screen recorded, whether using Zoom, a third party app, or the phone's settings....
Very good! Thankful to be able to meet at least in Zoom rooms at thus time. A truly great resource! Ã°Å¸â„¢â€š
after reading comments i feel that this is Worst app but after downloading i see no network problem no screen error occur and no voice error occur this and google meet is best
This is an excellent app and makes the world smaller. If you look at any of the negative reviews you will normally find that it is their hardware or the quality of their internet connection that is the problem. Despite working with so many different devices and internet providers etc, ZOOM usually works anyway. The controls are pretty intuitive. A great app. Update: Continue to grow their capabilities and is a very valuable connection during the pandemic.
Excellent for meetings or just talking with multiple friends at the same time with everyone able to see each other.
It was a well connected experience with no real technical interruption during the seminor. Will recommend zoom to friends and colleagues for their virtual seminors.and meetings.
Very nice app......I use it mostly now a days.... For school also I use it..........My friends, family members also prefer to use it even a bit of slow but a good app
This is very useful for all children for online classes.This is very great.This conserves very less amount of data.We can use Mobile Data(Cellular Data) or we can use our wifi.This app is vey intresting to listen online classes.We can chat with anybody in this.We can record and we can listen our online classes later is we donot understand at that time when classes are going on.We can share our screen.We can talk.We can show our videos in this.I will appreciate this app very much
I love it! The conference calls are good! And no ads my mom used it she used it for like years!! And the settings are good
Its really fun,i always use it everyday to like chat,study online and etc.i rated it 5 stars because you can actually use filters nad backgrounds i luv it
I just love this app, this is very useful for online classes and meeting ,I installed this app for my daughter ,she has online classes so this is very useful.my daughter and I love this app
The experience with zoom is fantastic. I got the best way of visual conferencing . So I thank Ã°Å¸â„¢Â zoom for it.Ã°Å¸Ââ€¦Ã°Å¸Ââ€ Ã°Å¸Â¦â€œÃ°Å¸ËœÂ
Absolutely brilliant n a very professional platform, for all kinds of business needs, great job and thank you.
Wonderful but after 40 minutes stucks...... Should charge for more than 2 hrs lec Also allow the mutiple meetings to be started at a time doesn't let my online classes to start
I love this app very much many intresting features like background, filters, video background and many more. Ã°Å¸ËœÅ 
To be able to see and hear the voices of my loved ones has kept me sane during this pandemic At work, the feature to put our meetings into separate groups is fantastic
Very reliable, user friendly, zoom has been a life line in the current covid situation. Well done zoom
Best for online classes but one problem the host cannot increase the meeting time as after 40 minutes it disconnects automatically.
Need to be able to add background pictures like on iPhones. (Much better now has virtual backgrounds for Android phones.)
Thank you Team Zoom, it's a beautiful App that has enabled millions of people keep intouch especially during this Covid-19 pandemic! Millions of my spiritual family and friends across the world have benefited from your service. We can now widen out through virtual Kingdom Halls all over the world :-) . Keep it up Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
I love this app. I find this app very useful because I use it every day. You could use this app for work, or just to talk to your friends. You are allowed to chat in text form, send audio messages, and of course, go on zoom meetings. You must put in your email to get started,but once your on, you can change your name in settings. This app is very useful. Download now. -Kali
Awesome App for both personal and business use. In the post pandemic world, Zoom allowed me to keep intense communication
You know it's a good APP when you enjoy the experience without worrying about the technology. ZOOM ticks all the boxes
I am so grateful for your app Thank you. I've even zoomed in to a Bible based your at the British museum. Zooming keeps me educated and busy . Thank you Ã°Å¸ËœÅ 
Excellent app and simple one to navigate through. Works with less Internet connection as well at times..
I feel like android is better for zoom and it is just an amazing source of calling too i would really recommend this.
It is very helpful for the students who take classes in the zoom app because school are closed and we easily take classes and we easily connect to our friends by zoom app.
Great App, m very happy with this app.. It's very easy to understand and I really loved it Ã°Å¸ËœËœÃ°Å¸ËœËœÃ°Å¸ËœËœÃ°Å¸ËœËœÃ°Å¸ËœËœ

The app is good , but in meeting if some on their mic then it show him/her video . Which is disturb to concentrate , plz help me . Or fix the glitch Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€
Wonderful experiences every time and I'm very happy with the quality of reception and voice feedback.
Thank you for making it possible for us to have our religious meeting as Jehovah's witnesses. I appreciate this form of communicating with my fellow worshipers. The zoom is excellent. Thank you.
Zoom really helpful for us as student and i request to add more features to chat box because we cannot delete wrong msg.
This app is literally essential for anyone who is an entrepreneur or has to talk to more than 3 people at once.
This app has enabled me to keep my sanity. Never have issues. Great app. Definitely recommend.
Very good application and I use it in my learning but only the problem it leaves a meeting when th Wi-Fi is poor or it good status
great app for online classes voice quality best and video quality is also very good experience and more better than google meet loved this app it is great app
This app is very nice but the problem is this why they are password giving whichever please give only one password in all subjects+Meeting ID
Good app but need to improve in chat...i couldnt see my calender even you ask me about the calender...actually havent join it..no stickers in chat is the problem
This app has been a God-send during the pandemic. The audio and video qualities are excellent.
It is very nice Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’ app for listening online classes because there is no chance to listen live classes due to covid19 that is the reason it is nice
It is a very nice app for online classes .It helped me in my online classes .So now,in pendemic all the classes are offline that is why it is very useful app Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸â€˜Â
THIS I AN AMAZINGÃ°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸ËœÂÃ°Å¸Â¤Â© APP. HERE U CAN CHAT, SEND AUDIOS, SHARE SCREENS, RECORD, AND A LOT OF E.T.C... ALL THESE OPTIONS I LOVE. AND A GRAND THANKS TO THE CREATOR. THANKSÃ°Å¸ËœÂÃ°Å¸ËœÂÃ°Å¸ËœÂ...
Really happy with the service, there are quite rarely network issues and overall the application is by far my favourite for online classes :)
Awesome app. Thank you now I can still work from home and connect with my clients. I like the new features being added.
This is very helpful app. It helped me a lot. I just love this app. That's why I have given 5 stars in it. Till now I have no problems about it.
Good aap with many functionalities. Helps alot in covid days. Provide good association among teacher and students.
"Great way to see and interact with people while adhering to ""social-distancing"" during this pandemic."
One of the best ways to communicate during this time period and maybe for the future under applicable situations.
Because of zoom I can enter the class instead of going to the school and It was really helpful for me and we will be able to overcome of this COVID-19.
Still loving this platform and how you can share screens and screen shot inform if needed. Brilliant for meetings or tea with friends!
It was an amazing app. I found that it is providing better video screen. Voice system is also too good. But sometimes when I on my video camera then also it is showing off to others. That is the Ã°Å¸â€˜â€°only problem,otherwise it is fantastic.
When I tried to open a meeting to verify that it opens, it was saying that I wrote the wrong password but when I tried to open the same meeting next day with the same password it opened that time.
Zoom has been a God sent for remote learning... the app is seamless... works well, easy to navigate for myself and my scholar...
There is one thing this app can do that other meeting apps cannot,that is to continue the meeting even after i have exhausted my data.
Excellent apps, very helpful.. But I hope soon they can add timer Ã¢ÂÂ²Ã¯Â¸Â because its very informant in the meeting.Ã°Å¸ËœÅ Ã°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸ÂÂ»Ã°Å¸ËœÂ·Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
Using free meeting conference for over a week , very satisfied with this app , no lag always on optimal condition Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
This is the best app ever it's the best app after houseparty because houseparty includes games etc.Otherwise this app is perfect for meetings Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸â€˜Å’Ã°Å¸ËœÆ’ I am really satisfied with this app (oh and also try houseparty tooÃ°Å¸Ëœâ€¦Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¹)
Wonderful app for online classes especially for teachers who can have a good control over the classes.
This is a very good app and the thing is it is free and the zoom cloud meeting is a very good app and I think it is the best app of the play store Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€°Ã°Å¸â„¢â€šÃ°Å¸ËœÅ . I am telling the truth I love the app.
This zoom is very very useful for learning the lessons. When we learn the free class are disconnected
TheZoom's reliable and stable performance Expect a smooth streaming experience. Out of the video conferencing apps we've tested, Zoom had the most reliable performance. Zoom has, on average, the least amount of latency and highest frame rates we could get out of an internet connection.
Excellent for meetings and official communication Best app when it comes to video calling with pefect voice and video clarity
This is a good app for educational purpose. It really helped me a lot. But this app use over data.
It was a fitness lesson and the reception has been excellent throughout this year since March lockdown. Can't fault this app.. Thank you.
It is good but try to add some more features so it will be helpful for teachers ... overall it's a good app
Nice app. This app is very useful in this time. But when the new version launch of zoom or the updating of this app. Please, It is my request.
Easy to use, convenient, works on all my devices. Excellent way to stay in touch!
Can u bring the option back to screen record other's meetings. Overall it's good .But please bring back that option or facility to screen record other's meetings.
Good but what to turn on is not clear to everyone. Like a microphone, etc.
Very good application for meetings... I suggest to increase the virtual backgrounds or leave it to the user to browse from local drives
Wonderful meeting application. I'd be lost without it. It's my lifeline to recovery. Not to mention my shares of Zoom are through the roof. Ã°Å¸Â¤Â£ Thank you Zoom!
It's worked well for me to connect with people. I haven't experienced technical difficulties. Thanks for developing this app
Zoom Meeting Apple has a problem with not being able to sing and can not change the profile picture. Everything is fine except that.
It is nice but it's network is not support. And it takes very time to connect.
WOW! With zoom, I have been able to collaborate well. It is better than Google meet
It's such an amazing app my child can easily learn and feels like they were in classroom.
Amazing,especially during lockdown.Extrordinarilly time and travel efficient,creating a wonderful flow on for ,'Our ONE Planet'.Countless jobs and businesses have survived, contributing very significantly to the survival of many Economies. ...All of this,before we even think about Education,healing -to life saving and that other 'life saving' gift of connection. Thankyou.
Still the best platform for video calls. Stable Not bandwidth consuming High quality Simple to use.
Good quality. Best then any other app. Very useful and time saving.
Providing Wonderful Communication Channel in these Pandemic Crisis, but there were some double logging issues through single account! It is to be addressed!
Zoom is a nice app I could meet my friends, chart with them .Screen share , chart and many more options .This is a nice app install it.
Hi guys this is the best app in the world you can also download this app for you and your child this is so useful app we can meet our friends and relatives itself and for school there in the school there are forwarding the link and it is easy for joining and we can select a team wallpaper this is the best
Excellent I am using it from 2 years for online studies. I don't notice any problems in zoom app Thank you for this best app
Very nice, app beacause we talk with lots of people for 40 minutes because it has a rule for our eyes because talk more than 40 mintues we have to glasses
It's amazing experience for me!!This app has became very helpful to me for attending my schools.
Zoom's reception is better and am more acquainted with the use now even though I am old school. Kudos
It is a wonder full app !!! For online classes sometimes there are issues but further it is not a big problem finally i loved it
It is A very use ful app for school students teachers and all others and we can use in family also it is having a good video quality
Excellent video and audio quality. No doubt this is the best meeting apps ever.
In starting I use to don't understand zoom but than they give instructions with that i know everything now , it's very nice app Ã°Å¸ËœÅ 
Please add virtual background option in mobile phones to make the app more better. Otherwise the app is very nice and also recommended app by me...
Excellent means of communication. Far superior and easier to use than Skype.
It is very good but when there is network not good the sound Ã°Å¸â€Å  is not clear but this app is simply amazingÃ°Å¸Â¤Â©Ã°Å¸ËœÂ
This is a awesome apps. Very useful and effective. During the pendamick time the zoom apps using many parpas
You can talk or chat with people take the test and also you can get it it is the best. And it is for free down load it now and you can chat with people today.
It gives me much pleasure in my studies and other my meetings.But I think it can be much nice and upgraded. Overall I can say that it is a very good app.
Zoom is making things possible that didn't feel possible months ago. It's easy to use and share
May I suggest to add a feature to disable receiving camera view to save some internet, also maybe the same for screen sharing. Basically, if the teacher has his camera on just to show his face, and you're using unnecessary mobile data for that, it would be nice to turn off camera view download.
In the existing world when the world is taken over by pandemic due to Covid-19. All the educational institutions and offices are closed in many parts of the world. The zoom app is the is the only app which is providing online educational facilities to the students.
Zoom is an excellent platform for everything from company meetings to arts and craft tutorials.
I have also been using it since March 2020 every day there hasn't been a problem since,until the August and September updates came. Now, it's barely seconds before the whole meeting is inaudible... the video and audio lag, though if I connect through my laptop, it works fine. It had been 5 stars before. Could the developers check what's going wrong? By dialling in first, even if the call doesn't go through, then I go back and join through the call over the Internet, it works fine. Now it's fine.
Iam give 5 star for onling clas and works..blablala. But i not like one of thing that only take that one from next update. What mean we are one class or work we press home button mens the class or work is going on background. That is not problem. We press that back button mens or opning other app mens the video is off. And we go paticpasion list to go mens also video is off this one take in next update plzzzÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢ÂÃ°Å¸â„¢Â
I love the zoom because in which we all are stay connected and we never forgot our responsibility I love zoom I love zoom I love zoom very very very very many much we all are very luckky because the. Company start the app zoom we are ver lucky to stay connected with our friends and best friends as well as aur teachers I like the zoom and hme study produce hotti h teachers se so we have to stay connected because if we not connected with each other we forgot every friends and teachers as well....
It is so good and there is one problem I have updated zoom but there is no virtual background, but Video and audio quality is also very good.
Zoom aap is the best aap for video conference as well as audio conference. Video and audio quality is also very good.
It's very nice app for students and teachers in this pandemic situation for continuing their study for their bright future
Wonderful for business and the new day age and era were in. Will recommend to anyone in the field of business and making life better and safer due to the pandemic.
Really good application to meet, hangout, and Chat. I'd like to rate it 5 Stars. But the issue is that I don't Know how to change My profile picture.
Very cool app best functionality...just meeting creation n joining needs to be made more user friendly..
This is a good app To join meeting for online egucation. But this need more network. Then also a excellent Meeting app,
Very good app one issue is that it consumes more data.Please verify this issue.Apart from this issue the app is wonderful and excellent.
Aside from the delay of transmission to other users, I prefer to use this platform because it has everything I need.
Wonderful as zoom allows us to see and interact with friends, thank you.
Zoom functions with less bandwidth compared to the other digital platforms. Thank you. Ã°Å¸ËœÆ’
This is the best learning app experience. From this I never expected virtual learning to be fun. Thanks Zoom!
This is very good app you can see anyone from anywhere with this app and I do my classes with this this app and I like it's hd video calling feature it is an amazing app Ã°Å¸â€˜Â
Nice experience exept internet conectivity issue from our end voice is very clear..video quality must be modified little more...
This app is great since the last update. They fixed a lot of things, but I still can't choose a background. I'm not worrying, since I know this is an issue with my computer, but would like a feature added where it can tell the user if their computer is compatible with that function. Overall, this is a great app, maybe even greater than Skype! I do worry when a vaccine will be invented for COVID-19, as Zoom will probably go out of business. If they don't, may they live on forever!
It is a very very very nice app but there was a problem for all students, the students can't share the screen and only the host can share the screen
"Toward the start of the pandemic, I purchased a premium plan for Zoom. When after they replaced some of the rules allowing longer meetings on their ""free"" plan, I'm glad I purchased it. This has been a wonderful tool to maintain friendships in door of our physical isolation. We now use it to also attend lecture. It's ready to use, but very powerful with many capabilities."
During these difficult times Zoom has been excellent. Family and other meetings for us work extremely well.
I enjoy using this app for all my meetings, school and groups they come in clear and audible everything thanks
Audio doesn't work correctly.
Very very nice app clear sound, clear video, every thing is good but please add virtual background mode on Android plzz
5 ratings to this app .but in new update ,there is security option ,I updated but still it is not showing the security option .
Very nice app for communicate. In the time of lock down I have just used this app for my lectures. Thanks zoom
I Always Use This App For My Online And Zoom Meeting Classes It's Really Helpful I love studying and Thanks for Zoom i can study more! I just really love this application Ã°Å¸â€™â€”
It is very super app. During this lockdown it is very helpful for the students and teachers.

Great platform! Excellent customer service and responsive designers. Well done!
this damn thing is wonderful it's perfect for private rooms to have online sex in it felt really good and you can meet yourself if you're being too loud when you're moaning
Zoom meeting is good but try to improve like students can also record the meeting when they are using the app
I love Zoom! Thank you for providing great quality, great sound and unlimited time to connect with family and friends. I love the waiting room, privacy options and security features on Zoom! Thank you for offering a wonderful virtual experience!
This app is so good for just about now in time where you can't meet up with people fishing face or you don't want to meet up with you face to face because of this virus that is going around

This is a wonderful app and it has never ever had any problems. I use it for my online school classes. I am delighted and grateful to the app owners for making the last 4 updates that literally pushed the app up on the 1st position among all other meeting, video calling or webinar supportable apps. I have it on my PC too and I can use the PC easily for connecting to a meeting. It never crashes like some apps do. I think it's really great. If I could, I would give 10 stars for my rating.
Great to use for classes, seeing family and attending meetings and hearings.
Excellent...most trusted friend during the most difficult times of pandemic. This app helped us to keep afloat the spirit of many of my friends across the globe. Infinite gratitude. Keep it up and going.
Zoom so fun because you get to meet new friends and you also got to learn and it's so much fun because it's been these through these hard times it's not really easy but you still get to me earlier all of your friends and family
Thank you very much to you and your team for creating your zoom application and using the 40 minute period in your zoom application today and giving you more unlimited time. Thank you very much for the benefit.
Great video call and user experience. It is the best video call app out there.
It is very good app best clear and good quality video and i suggest to everyone that download for my experience loved it !!!!!!...

I like this app, this app is very usefull for meetings. This is the best app for meetings but there is a problem i can't set a profile picture from my device Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥Ã°Å¸ËœÂ¥
Great app for online video conferencing. Keeps on getting better.
Thank you so much and now I can See my friends and My Teacher and my Teacher can teach everyone :D I love this app it's the best app :)
Astounding app, connection is great, no problems at all. I suggest this app, there is much use of this app because the quality of zoom is really astonishing and Zoom is the leader in modern enterprise video communications, with an easy, reliable cloud platform for video and audio conferencing. Start meeting instantly with your colleagues for free. Professional video meetings on your time, to keep your business growing. Good luck with Zoom
It's relatively easy to learn to use for users that have joined conference calls before. I do wish I could share a different audio when I choose to share screen from a mobile device running zoom app; this seems to be only available on a computer running zoom.
"""ZOOM"" Cloud Meeting app is best for me. I want to say something, if possible to increase some functions like ""Lock screen"". Because when we join meeting or class, then sometimes it's by mistake to click other options like ""unmute"" or ""video on"". Then it's feel very bad to us. So if possible, please increase this option immediately. Thank you."
This is a nice meeting app and ever since the start of the covid pandemic I have used it to stay in touch with my friends and to attend my school's online classes. This is an exceptionally nice app. Hats off to the creators Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã¢ÂÂ¤Ã°Å¸â€˜Â. I highly recommend to everyone to install this app. I love it!!!
I really like this app. Its so useful. I do online class in zoom. And this may use everyone. We can do classs in zoom and we can call our family members together, if they stay away from me. We talk your our whole family together. I like this app . And thanks for supporting us to do our important thing very easily at home. Thank you so much
Top notch. Works easily. Works well. Can offer at least temporary confusion to those who frequently skim content for actions, i.e. those expecting fully intuitive presentation. For example, the Sign In button being all by itself and huge, when not paying attention, can lead participants to think they need to use it instead of simply waiting for a meeting to start.
It's good or maybe the goodest app I think if any update comes so there should be a video telling us how to join the meeting its a good idea maybe but in my opinion it's best what about zoom makers do they like my opinion Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¡Ã°Å¸Â¤â€
Zoom Meetings are wonderful but I don't get to unlock the full benefits of Zoom. The CHAT is wonderful so I Love Zoom anyways
Excellent!! Clarity, sounds and features are perfect!@ THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
It is very helpful to watch all at a time Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬ sometimes there's a stuck position also.
I am loving this app Ã°Å¸â€˜â€°Ã°Å¸â€œÂ± because In my Ã°Å¸â€œÅ¡study Ã°Å¸â€œÅ¡Ã¢Å“Â means online class I don't know anything but when I start using this app Ã°Å¸â€˜â€°Ã°Å¸â€œÂ±It is easy for me to join my all online classes!!! Ã°Å¸ËœÅ Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€¡Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€°Ã°Å¸ËœÅ’Ã°Å¸Â¤â€”Ã°Å¸Â¤â€œÃ°Å¸Â¤Â 
Very good app Ã°Å¸â€˜ÂÃ°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬ I am very satisfied with this app and the quality of meeting Ã°Å¸ËœÅ  is nice lovely app for class meeting and other .
I am truly grateful for the availability and use of zoom for my meetings of worship to Jehovah God during this pandemic. It's been more than an answer to prayers. I could almost assume this business and idea has been heaven sent to be a lifeline to the world, friends and family. BRAVO to all those working with the ZOOM company who make this avenue of communication available to us all- to the rich and the poor, the isolated and free, to those sick at home and in hospital, and those at work.
This is an excellent data saving video conferencing app. It is extremely good.
I love this service and this phone app. I have been using zoom mostly on my computer for 4 years and only 1 year ago moved primarily to my phone. The app is beautiful works well and for me provides a great way of accessing the incredible zoom service. I love how you guys crushed Skype and all the other pretenders to voice conferencing.
I find this video platform is very stable and east to use. A real asset on my phone.
Wow the app is awesome. But there is one problem virtual backgrounds are not in android.
UPDATE 11/02/20: Looks like version 5.4 fixed the dark front camera issue, working good now. UPDATE 10/14/20: New 5.3 version updated on 10/12 is still not working properly. Same dark front camera. ORIGINAL: There's a bug in version 5.3 that blacks out the front video camera on my Pixel 2. This makes me look like I am in the dark, even in fully lit rooms. I reverted to version 5.2 and it works great. Please address this bug.
This is a great app...nothing to say any fault..thanks for everyone who created and develop this...all the best zoom team.
It was good, but from last one week it was not working properly. Actually I can't share my screen through zoom app
Zoom has turned out to be an amazing tool for AA and NA. When Covid hit, our little group, in a very small town, got on zoom immediately. Not only were we able to attend our own meetings but some of us started going to meetings around the world thanks to zoom. And now that we have just a couple of in person meetings a week l, we keep zoom on because addicts and alcoholics are reaching out and we want to be there when anyone reaches out for help. Zoom has definitely been a blessing.
Zoom is absolutely AWESOME! We use zoom for our spiritual meetings, we have 6 meetings a week. Without Zoom things would be so different. With Zoom we are able to keep in touch with our friends & family. To really see their faces to make sure they are doing well. I would recommend zoom to anyone and everyone who wants to reach out & see their family in real time. Zoom has made this Covid-19 Pandemic a lot easier to deal with. Thank You Zoom & all your employees who continue to keep zoom working!
Very nice app for visual meeting, teacher,and so on and if you say the app is malfunctioning i think u should update it
Superb guys keep going and this gonna be famous with more users. Good controls and like the visuals.
Implemented as part of my website to support online meetings, great program, support, and user friendly interface. They are constantly listening to ideas and improving the product services. What more could you want in a modern solution.
It's excellent! I use it for online classes and it's so much easier! :)
Easy to log on. No confusions, many ways to join a meeting such as by phone, voice , video. Which is very good for all ages including seniors to use phone if they are not comfortable with video or audio. The person who designed this is smart n it is wining . I will use it again . Hope u do not change like other apps for worse
Zoom is a video-calling app that is ideal for large groups because it supports up to 100 users for free. It is widely being used for meetings, online learning, and university lectures, among other things. The app has become immensely popular as people have been forced to stay indoors due to the lockdown.1.If you're using the app on the computer, simply click on Share Screen which is on the bottom bar of the meeting window.2.You'll see various options here Ã¢â‚¬â€ under basic, you will be able
Zoom is our lifeline for last 6 months. Iuse only the mobile app, so my views only based on that experience. Giving a 5, but following things could improve. 1. Android phones should also get option to create virtual background. I think its only available on i-phones currently. 2. On my screen I should be able to decide how may participants i want. Currently you see 4 participants by default. I should be able to change it.
It has saved my ass during this pandemic! Seriously!! It continues to do so. How do I rate an app that is literally saving my life? Gonna need more than five stars! Months later this is still literally saving me. I won't say exactly how, because that's not the point. The point is, because of what Zoom facilitates, I can continue to be okay, one day at a time. Keep coming back, it Zooms if you Zoom it!
This was great I experienced all the apps this is the best even though it has some bugs it still works
I have really enjoyed ZOOM since we went into lockdown because of the pandemic. It has allowed me to stay in touch with my friends and continue attend meetings with my congregation. I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and ZOOM has helped us with our meetings. I think we only missed one meeting since COVID began - and that was the very first one. Thank you so much for helping all of Jehovah's Witnesses to continue learning about our loving God, Jehovah and helping us to stay strong spiritually.
Love zoom. It's saved me in lockdown with my work and all the meetings I have to attend online now.
I am harsh sharma student it is excellent app only network is needed it do every thing so nicely it has record feature also it is an nice app it get 5+ stars more than 5 it has screen sharing and different actions and it has computer app also.
This app is great. I use this app for class in meetings. This app helps me communicate with my friends and teacher and online school. And we still use it. We only use it for school because now we are in person but, but we still login to zoom. Great app, highly recommended
Really cool app. if your a teacher and your starting online class?this is the perfect one! Highly recommend.
I love this app because I am attending classes in it it helped all children during the covid period fir their classes
Brilliant ZUMBA classes with this app, requires a good stable connection. Gives me a great solid meeting for my zumba classes with my instructor Rosie berry who's amazing at her job but the zoom make it so easy to meet with her.
Easy to use...keeps many connected, across miles or even down the road!
I use this app twice a week to experience speaking & seeing people without having to worry about contracting covid-19. It is a great way to be around people you would normally be around every week in person. I guess you would call it virtual reality! After the meeting, our host puts 3-7 in a room to chat and you can leave at anytime within about an hour! We really have a great time in this virtual reality room! I'm only around my close family members & Docs when l need to see them.
This app is amazing...it has many facilities also...it is good app for e-learning...
"Hi friends, please can you make the zoom version for android TV box to be optimize close to windows and MAC versions due to the larger screen display for the TV box. I'm still finding it difficult to use zoom video on my box, this is the information that usually display on the screen "" ensure that other apps are not sharing the camera and try again later."" Please can you help to fix the issue."
I love this application is flexible easy to understand incredible for my business thank God for zoom in this pandemic era
Zoom is excellent for participation in our field service , Watchtower, and public talks !! I give it the HIGHEST LEVEL of ratings.!!! Thank you.
This is such a nice app for conference meetings especially it' s a very useful for students while Online classes
My experience on this app has been amazing I absolutely love it. It's incredible I would totally recommend it.
Easy to understand and use this application. I use it for my classes and I've had absolutely no problem with this app. Great idea especially through our social distancing period. Love it. Thank you!
The app is best. I don't have any issue. I read reviews one i got that the video seems in participant that video is off. Reason is that when we go in participant our video pause automatically so our video seems to be pause.
This app is very useful techer we can mute the students and etc for me it is a very nice app but i want to change my photo in dp it is not why ?? In zoom
Very good app This helps me to do my online classes very well Problem is not enabling virtual background
It's a really useful app, during this period especially.It's helping us to keep up the communication withfriends&family. I'm using it for my Online Classees.There's one issue that, whenever my network crashesin the middle of the class, I'm losing at least aminimul part of my attending lecture. Technically,it's not the problem of the app, but if the developerscould create an option so that i could get back what Ilost regarding network crash, that would have been aserious helping hand.
Really easy to use, excellent full duplex sound. Best functionality and call quality of all the similar apps (as at October 2020). The free account allows allows unlimited time for 2 parties, or 40 minutes for 3 or more parties (simply restart meeting every 40 minutes). Works well casting to TV screen. Displays current speaking person, or swipe right to see 4 users per screenful. Virtual background with inbuilt scenes or your own photos. Personal meeting room lets you email a permanent link.
It is excellent but there is some problem even though I on the video it shows like it is off. Plz see that this will get fixed
It is a very user-friendly app and it also has too much facilities like sharing screens which include whiteboard, URL, document, photo and it also connects Microsoft one drive and Google drive with it to share content present inside those, it has a great facility of chatting privately and so on. We cannot describe it in a few words. So I will personally prefer everyone to try this app once and I am sure that they will fall in love with this app and will not want to use any other conferencing app
BRILLIANT APP I really like this app in home to perform online classes firstly there was some bad audio quality but now after the new update it is perfectÃ¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â
Awesome product! This covid-19 pandemic would be far more impactful without Zoom.
Very execellent app in meeting my school is taking online class in zoom app and i understand every thing that my teacher teach me in class but i am giving it four star because the voice is cutting in between meeting so i cant hear the word that were tought by teacher in that limited time so i request the zoom to overcome and solve the voice problem
It is very comfortable app with clear video and audio calls conferencing I like it very much
This is a very good app to talk or meeting with friends and teachers
It is really helpful for students and I literally like this app. And the one thing which I like about it is that there is no error in this app.
Connected during lockdown. My favourite app. Very useful in team discussion/projects and education, e.g. lectures. Can be used to facilitate project management but requires other software. Zoom is simple to use, placing most responsibility upon the 'host', who may add structure. To everyone else, attend and contribute - a meeting is not the same without you.
Best app for online classes good quality audio and video . Rating this app five stars . But the only problem is that sometimes the phone hangs because of zoom and sometimes videos get freezed. Please fix these problems .
Good very efficient..... only they do not give to record the meeting without subscription
I can do meetings, chat, livestreaming and recording (only in desktops) and many more. The UI is also nice. Also after Zoom updated, it shows the data center you are connected to in meeting statistics during a meeting. New features are added and the app deserves a 4 star just the fact that the meeting experience is little bad with Mobile data but ya Mobile data gives you a bad data speed than WiFi but the app is guilty. So use WiFi for this app. It's a very nice app for doing creative things.
I like this app l can see very clear and if my network is slow than also it is clear
I use zoom every day! Fire my business and for friends and family meetups since we live in virtual world these days. Simple enough for even my mom to get it, technically speaking.
Awesome volume has best ping practically that means no lag and I think that can help everyone not stress
Please fix some bugs when I am attending a meeting there is a rule to turn on my video and when I am attending a meeting I am turning on my video but it is showing off in participants and I am always getting a scolding. This all happened when I updated this app. I give 5 stars because I like this app very much.
So smooth running good quality . and after update it's very good to see.
It's great but please add a feature that allows the host to add participants while screen-sharing.
Amazing app for video calling... As I m teacher and I m doing all my classes on zoom only...
This app is everything it claims to be and more.Not only does it Exceed expectations,it transforms a mobile device into a fully staffed fortune 500 company that fits in your pocket. Absolutely cutting edge. O yeah by the way , thank you
Zoom is such a great way to meet with friends especially since we are all facing the effects of this pandemic.
Excellent, I can attend my classes Ã°Å¸Ëœâ€žÃ°Å¸ËœÅ But the virtul baground dosent come only showing Raise hand , Chat ,meeting setting, disconnect audio in my android phone
Extremely satisfied with the quality of the Zoom service. Thanks
I like this app very much. Its very nice app for meetings. I really like this app very much.
As useful as possible for groups of friends, business, and doctors visits.
First, I am student of Santa Monica College and I have been using Zoom Meeting Platform since March 18, 2020. It was working well from March 2020, but from two weeks ago until now. While I am attending to Zoom Meeting for my classes, twice times I went out from Zoom and automatically back to Zoom. I uninstall and reinstall Zoom application from two weeks ago until now, but I still seethis issue. Will you please tell me what I can do now?
Amazing itself to talk with each other by a link ok to see calendar download Outlook you can set schedule which can remember you that you have a meeting you can add contacts by sending them email aur aur sending request to add you in friend list and then you can chat with that person and call you do not need any Sim to use this app just you need a Facebook account or Google account how can there will be another option SOS just to login and if you do not want to login it works without login .
It's a great app to help one connect with people online, for meetings any type of meeting
This was the first time I've attended an online meeting and I absolutely loved it.Obviously it isn't the same as being in the same room with someone.but it was certainly very productive and enjoyable,and if an absolute technical incompetent like me can do it anyone can!
This is very useful to all student teachers etc. I like this app very much. This is very useful app.This app help all students to take class. I want to say thank you to that person who make this zoom app. That person do very very good work. I like zoom app.
Its Nice App For Buissnessman,Child Or another persons for meeting it mostly useful like this period because of covid 19 we can't go to the our jobs or our works so we can use Zoom like this apps for meetingsÃ°Å¸â„¢Ë†
It's really awesome app....it has all the contents necessary for conducting any meeting.....but it doesn't show the time at which the host has started the meeting.
There are many bad reviews saying that the voice is inaudible , Its buffering, but it's their Internet Connection's problem, not the app's , Yes ,if you think that this app is bad , it always Buffering, the voice cracks , ITS NOT A BUG , ITS YOUR INTERNET'S FAULT , , it's a good app, There IS a bug which I dont think Is my mobile's fault , There is a bug in which my video is on but in Participants , it says it's off , So my teachers are getting confused and is telling me to on my vid
It is a good app it was only app i found which was able to record without a domain mail.
Zoom well it's a good app but many problems are there when you use it in a computer , we have to join from the browser when it says network problem and also in mobile we are disconnected with audio. But the app is very good in performance .
Initially getting hooked up and going was a bit of a hassle. There was no instructions to guide me .ssssoooo the first 5 minutes finding my way with the others on already waiting for me to get going . I found my way through the dark then I found out how to navigate the rest while we were in our meeting. Ok who ever wrote this program needs to put some how to steps in there so beginners don't fumble around and look stupid .thanks for reading . If you have step by step already . I'll find them
Great app.... seriously...so satisfied with this. It's easy to use and gives all controls in the hand of the host.... making a co host is also a very helpful feature. I didn't face any glitches while using this as far as I know and it's the best meeting app I've used...I just hope that my school teachers get this =_=
This app is perfect. I use it to chat with friends and watch movies with them.
This app is amazing for my meeting.Thanks to zoom developers.How make an amazing app for all over word
The video quality is very good but it cuts audio after every word.Previous version had good audio and video quality A lot of other people are also facing this problem .I hope that you will fix this issue soon.The older version was way better than this updated trash.
It's a wonderful app..one of the best I've seen so far for video conferencing!
It is best app for my son online classes it is very nice app but my son is saying he is not getting virtual backgroud option when he is attending class please cheak this problem
Delighted to be able to keep in touch with each other and have religious meetings during lockdown.
This is very very important to people meet with their rilativs specially inthis Moment of lock down. So, thank you to make this app.
This App is very helpful and useful for all students and teachers during Lockdown.
Zoom has been a great tool for my church during this pandemic 2020. It has allowed us to carry on with our church ministry to our adults and children. There were a few kinks to iron out as we've come along but it allowed the kids to visibly see us as we taught, which we found important.
Outstanding app. A very responsive company. I can't sing their praises enough for what they've done for people, communities & principalities across the US. They've allowed many families & people groups to keep functioning in this SARS-CoV-2 environment. Great job Zoom family. Keep up the good work. Thank you also for providing free time for those who can't sustain a monthly fee. You ROCK!
Being teacher it is an excellent app for online teaching and learning.
Great platform especially during the pandemic. It's our go to mode.
Excellent app for teaching I love it I am teacher my students can ask me things clearly it share screen clearly we can chat with students. but when I teaches in Microsoft team app it was useless. Zoom thank you for helping me and my students in this covid time big salute . You must download zoom Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬
I used this app for online class for my college 1st year during corona period it is helpful app . But there is a small problem I used this app for 4 days smoothly without any problem .but the voice will struck and net work problem will come . It is a ordinary small problem.it is not problem. My problem is that iused this app for 4 days without any problem . After 5th day i cannot able to enter into the meeting.iswitch off my phone and onned.i uninstalled,restarted.please reply me what is problem
Yeah for the virtual backgrounds for Androids! So excited to have the background available on my Android on the new update. I only use Zoom on my cell phone and I'm in my bedroom and dont want anyone to see how untidy I am. So I never showed myself. I dont use my computer much anymore and did not want to have to fire it up just to go on Zoom where I could add the virtual background. Thanks developers!
The video conference calls are clear on 4g lite. Even in areas of low connectivity, the narrow bandwidth hold the connection. The video is sharp and I'm able to see the host screen with clarity in both portrait and landscape mode. I'm even able to enter chat and view the number of participants similar to 10 inch table and 11 inch screen laptop. The best part that people always forget to mention is the ability to transfer app to sd card. Thanks zoom for that innovation.
A nice app but quality is less eventhough we have good net connections but apart from it super app
A good experience in zoom because it's video and audio quality is best
As one of Jehovah's Witnesses I have found this app to be extremely helpful in maintaining my spiritual life despite lock downs. I use it both on the phone and via my laptop. It is easy to use and seems more stable than other communication apps.
Thank you, this was the most POSITIVE impact to what im dealing with TODAY. My questions were answered, you were right ABOUT the negative effects from a Keto diet. I feel the medications are causing my imbalance. Side effects ALONE blurry vision, may cause dizziness. I have THESE symptoms beforehand. What i would LIKE is NOT to be diagnosed with ANOTHER disease. ONLY to be given another pill that doesn't interact with all the other ONES I'VE been taking. Thank you
It is very important app
It is very useful app for online classes and meetings. On laptop it is even more better.

Zoom is vrtual relaliry that makes it possible to hod meetings with various groups of people.In this covid 19 pandemic,zoom did a lot to save millions of people from infections,as keeping social distance is one of the major preventive measures in the corona virus conyrol. In this regard zoom conferences is a great tool in the fight against corona virus control
